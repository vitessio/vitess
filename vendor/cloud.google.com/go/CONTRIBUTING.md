## Integration Tests

In addition to the unit tests, you may run the integration test suite.

To run the integrations tests, creating and configuration of a project in the
Google Developers Console is required.

After creating a project, you must [create a service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount).
Ensure the project-level **Owner** [IAM role](console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam/project)
(or **Editor** and **Logs Configuration Writer** roles) are added to the
service account.

Once you create a project, set the following environment variables to be able to
run the against the actual APIs.

- **GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID**: Developers Console project's ID (e.g. bamboo-shift-455)
- **GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_KEY**: The path to the JSON key file.
- **GCLOUD_TESTS_API_KEY**: Your API key.

Install the [gcloud command-line tool][gcloudcli] to your machine and use it
to create the indexes used in the datastore integration tests with indexes
found in `datastore/testdata/index.yaml`:

From the project's root directory:

``` sh
# Set the default project in your env
$ gcloud config set project $GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID

# Authenticate the gcloud tool with your account
$ gcloud auth login

# Create the indexes
$ gcloud preview datastore create-indexes datastore/testdata/index.yaml
```

The Sink integration tests in preview/logging require a Google Cloud storage
bucket with the same name as your test project, and with the Stackdriver Logging
service account as owner:
``` sh
$ gsutil mb gs://$GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID
$ gsutil acl ch -g cloud-logs@google.com:O gs://$GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID
```

Once you've set the environment variables, you can run the integration tests by
running:

``` sh
$ go test -v cloud.google.com/go/...
```
