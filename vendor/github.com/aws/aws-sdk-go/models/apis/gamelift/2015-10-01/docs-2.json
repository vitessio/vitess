    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. You can use an alias to anonymize your fleet by referencing an alias instead of a specific fleet when you create game sessions. Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.</p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. To reassign the alias to another fleet ID, call <a>UpdateAlias</a>.</p>",
    "CreateBuild": "<p>Initializes a new build record and generates information required to upload a game build to Amazon GameLift. Once the build record has been created and is in an INITIALIZED state, you can upload your game build.</p> <important><p>To create a build, use the CLI command <code>upload-build</code>, which creates a new build record and uploads the build files in one step. (See the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a> for more details on the CLI and the upload process.) Call the <code>CreateBuild</code> action only if you have your own Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) client and need to manually upload your build files.</p></important> <p>To create a new build, optionally specify a build name and version. This metadata is stored with other properties in the build record and is displayed in the GameLift console (but not visible to players). If successful, this action returns the newly created build record along with an Amazon S3 storage location and AWS account credentials. Use the location and credentials to upload your game build.</p>",
    "CreateFleet": "<p>Creates a new fleet to host game servers. A fleet consists of a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances of a certain type, which defines the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity of each host in the fleet. See <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a> for more information. Each instance in the fleet hosts a game server created from the specified game build. Once a fleet is in an ACTIVE state, it can begin hosting game sessions.</p> <p>To create a new fleet, provide a name and the EC2 instance type for the new fleet, and specify the build and server launch path. Builds must be in a READY state before they can be used to build fleets. When configuring the new fleet, you can optionally (1) provide a set of launch parameters to be passed to a game server when activated; (2) limit incoming traffic to a specified range of IP addresses and port numbers; (3) set game session protection for all instances in the fleet, and (4) configure Amazon GameLift to store game session logs by specifying the path to the logs stored in your game server files. If the call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Creates a fleet record and sets the state to NEW.</li> <li>Sets the fleet's capacity to 1 \"desired\" and 1 \"active\" EC2 instance count.</li> <li>Creates an EC2 instance and begins the process of initializing the fleet and activating a game server on the instance.</li> <li>Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the GameLift console.</li> </ul> <p>Once a fleet is created, use the following actions to change certain fleet properties (server launch parameters and log paths cannot be changed):</p> <ul> <li> <a>UpdateFleetAttributes</a> -- Update fleet metadata, including name and description.</li> <li> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> -- Increase or decrease the number of instances you want the fleet to maintain.</li> <li> <a>UpdateFleetPortSettings</a> -- Change the IP addresses and ports that allow access to incoming traffic.</li> </ul>",
    "CreateGameSession": "<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns the new session to an instance in the specified fleet, which activates the server initialization process in your game server. A fleet must be in an ACTIVE state before a game session can be created for it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID and indicate the maximum number of players the game session allows. You can also provide a name and a set of properties for your game (optional). If successful, a <a>GameSession</a> object is returned containing session properties, including an IP address. By default, newly created game sessions are set to accept adding any new players to the game session. Use <a>UpdateGameSession</a> to change the creation policy.</p>",
    "CreatePlayerSession": "<p>Adds a player to a game session and creates a player session record. A game session must be in an ACTIVE state, have a creation policy of ALLOW_ALL, and have an open player slot before players can be added to the session.</p> <p>To create a player session, specify a game session ID and player ID. If successful, the player is added to the game session and a new <a>PlayerSession</a> object is returned. </p>",
    "CreatePlayerSessions": "<p>Adds a group of players to a game session. Similar to <a>CreatePlayerSession</a>, this action allows you to add multiple players in a single call, which is useful for games that provide party and/or matchmaking features. A game session must be in an ACTIVE state, have a creation policy of ALLOW_ALL, and have an open player slot before players can be added to the session.</p> <p>To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs.

    "DeleteFleet": "<p>Deletes everything related to a fleet. Before deleting a fleet, you must set the fleet's desired capacity to zero. See <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>.</p> <p>This action removes the fleet's resources and the fleet record. Once a fleet is deleted, you can no longer use that fleet.</p>",
