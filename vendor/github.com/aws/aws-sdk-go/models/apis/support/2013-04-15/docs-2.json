Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes. </li> <li> <b>SeverityCode.</b> A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by calling <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a>.</li> <li> <b>Subject.</b> The <b>Subject</b> field on the AWS Support Center <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create\">Create Case</a> page.</li> <li> <b>CommunicationBody.</b> The <b>Description</b> field on the AWS Support Center <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create\">Create Case</a> page.</li> <li> <b>AttachmentSetId.</b> The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by using <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a>.</li> <li> <b>Language.</b> The human language in which AWS Support handles the case.
