When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data you get might be up to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download the vault inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory for each vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find the vault inventory useful. For example, when you upload an archive, you can provide an archive description but not an archive name. Amazon Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque string of characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive names to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile information in your database with the actual vault inventory. </p> <p><b>Range Inventory Retrieval</b></p> <p>You can limit the number of inventory items retrieved by filtering on the archive creation date or by setting a limit.</p> <p><i>Filtering by Archive Creation Date</i></p> <p>You can retrieve inventory items for archives created between <code>StartDate</code> and <code>EndDate</code> by specifying values for these parameters in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. Archives created on or after the <code>StartDate</code> and before the <code>EndDate</code> will be returned. If you only provide the <code>StartDate</code> without the <code>EndDate</code>, you will retrieve the inventory for all archives created on or after the <code>StartDate</code>. If you only provide the <code>EndDate</code> without the <code>StartDate</code>, you will get back the inventory for all archives created before the <code>EndDate</code>.</p> <p><i>Limiting Inventory Items per Retrieval</i></p> <p>You can limit the number of inventory items returned by setting the <code>Limit</code> parameter in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The inventory job output will contain inventory items up to the specified <code>Limit</code>. If there are more inventory items available, the result is paginated. After a job is complete you can use the <a>DescribeJob</a> operation to get a marker that you use in a subsequent <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The marker will indicate the starting point to retrieve the next set of inventory items. You can page through your entire inventory by repeatedly making <b>InitiateJob</b> requests with the marker from the previous <b>DescribeJob</b> output, until you get a marker from <b>DescribeJob</b> that returns null, indicating that there are no more inventory items available.</p> <p>You can use the <code>Limit</code> parameter together with the date range parameters.</p> <p><b>About Ranged Archive Retrieval</b></p> <p> You can initiate an archive retrieval for the whole archive or a range of the archive. In the case of ranged archive retrieval, you specify a byte range to return or the whole archive. The range specified must be megabyte (MB) aligned, that is the range start value must be divisible by 1 MB and range end value plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or equal the end of the archive. If the ranged archive retrieval is not megabyte aligned, this operation returns a 400 response. Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for data you download using Get Job Output API, the range must be tree hash aligned. </p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

    "InitiateMultipartUpload": "<p>This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see <a>UploadMultipartPart</a>).</p> <p>When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.</p> <p>Every part you upload to this resource (see <a>UploadMultipartPart</a>), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. </p> <note><p>You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.</p></note> <p>After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID.

In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists. </p></note> <p>To retrieve an archive or retrieve a vault inventory from Amazon Glacier, you first initiate a job, and after the job completes, you download the data.
