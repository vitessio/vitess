  "service": "<fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a>. </p> <note> <p> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services page</a>. </p> </note> <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html\">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.

  "operations": {
    "AssumeRole": "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS APIs</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using AWS root account credentials; access is denied. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. </p> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html\">IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation)</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction\">Common Scenarios for Temporary Credentials</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code>, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to a maximum of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour. </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS service's <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> APIs.</p> <p>Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed, <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html\">Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate access to this account's role.</p> <p>The user who wants to access the role must also have permissions delegated from the role's administrator. If the user is in a different account than the role, then the user's administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole on the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can either attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous different account user), or you can add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces. </p>",
    "AssumeRoleWithSAML": "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated via a SAML authentication response.

Additionally, you must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your AWS account that represents your identity provider, and create an IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy. </p> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> does not require the use of AWS security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the <code>NameID</code> element of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a NameIDType that is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the Persistent Identifier (<code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</code>).</p> </important> <p>For more information, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html\">About SAML 2.0-based Federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml.html\">Creating SAML Identity Providers</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_relying-party.html\">Configuring a Relying Party and Claims</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_saml.html\">Creating a Role for SAML 2.0 Federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> </ul>",
    "AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity": "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider, such as Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito.

Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS root account credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS APIs.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by <code>GetFederationToken</code> are determined by a combination of the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that result from the <code>GetFederationToken</code> API call--that is, to the <i>federated user</i>. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials were used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>. AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated user <i> <b>and</b> </i> the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy.</p> <p>A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code> are designed to allow access to all the actions and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user. </p> <p>If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective permissions.

You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html\">Permissions for AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF).

The passed policy is used to scope down the permissions that are available to the IAM user, by allowing only a subset of the permissions that are granted to the IAM user.
