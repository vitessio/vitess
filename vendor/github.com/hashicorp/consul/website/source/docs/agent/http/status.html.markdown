# Status HTTP Endpoint

The Status endpoints are used to get information about the status
of the Consul cluster.

Please note: this information is generally very low level
and not often useful for clients.

The following endpoints are supported:

* [`/v1/status/leader`](#status_leader) : Returns the current Raft leader
* [`/v1/status/peers`](#status_peers) : Returns the current Raft peer set

### <a name="status_leader"></a> /v1/status/leader

This endpoint is used to get the Raft leader for the datacenter
in which the agent is running. It returns an address, such as:

```text
"10.1.10.12:8300"
```

### <a name="status_peers"></a> /v1/status/peers

This endpoint retrieves the Raft peers for the datacenter in which the
the agent is running. It returns a list of addresses, such as:

```javascript
[
  "10.1.10.12:8300",
  "10.1.10.11:8300",
  "10.1.10.10:8300"
]
```

This list of peers is strongly consistent and can be useful in determining when
a given server has successfully joined the cluster.
