/**
 * Context is an immutable object that carries per-request info.
 *
 * <p>RPC frameworks like gRPC have their own Context implementations that
 * allow propagation of deadlines, cancellation, and end-user credentials
 * across RPC boundaries (between client and server). Since these
 * framework-specific Context implementations are not compatible with one
 * another, we provide our own Context class that wraps common features.
 *
 * <p>In gRPC and other frameworks, the current Context is maintained in
 * thread-local storage, so it's implicitly available to any method that
 * needs it. In this Vitess client library, we pass Context as an explicit
 * parameter to methods that need it. This allows us to defer enforcement
 * of the specified request constraints until the request reaches the
 * underlying framework-specific Vitess client implementation, at which point
 * the native Context class can be used.
