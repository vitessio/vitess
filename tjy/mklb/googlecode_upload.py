#
# Script for uploading files to a Google Code project.
#
# This is intended to be both a useful script for people who want to
# streamline project uploads and a reference implementation for
# uploading files to Google Code projects.
#
# To upload a file to Google Code, you need to provide a path to the
# file on your local machine, a small summary of what the file is, a
# project name, and a valid account that is a member or owner of that
# project.  You can optionally provide a list of labels that apply to
# the file.  The file will be uploaded under the same name that it has
# in your local filesystem (that is, the "basename" or last path
# component).  Run the script with '--help' to get the exact syntax
# and available options.
#
# Note that the upload script requests that you enter your
# googlecode.com password.  This is NOT your Gmail account password!
# This is the password you use on googlecode.com for committing to
# Subversion and uploading files.  You can find your password by going
# to http://code.google.com/hosting/settings when logged in with your
# Gmail account. If you have already committed to your project's
# Subversion repository, the script will automatically retrieve your
# credentials from there (unless disabled, see the output of '--help'
# for details).
#
# If you are looking at this script as a reference for implementing
# your own Google Code file uploader, then you should take a look at
# the upload() function, which is the meat of the uploader.  You
# basically need to build a multipart/form-data POST request with the
# right fields and send it to https://PROJECT.googlecode.com/files .
# Authenticate the request using HTTP Basic authentication, as is
# shown below.
