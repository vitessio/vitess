\chapter{Open Publication License}
\label{cha:opl}

Version 1.0, 8 June 1999

\section{Requirements on both unmodified and modified versions}

The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole
or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the
terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.

Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:

\begin{quote}
  Copyright (c) \emph{year} by \emph{author's name or designee}. This
  material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions
  set forth in the Open Publication License, v\emph{x.y} or later (the
  latest version is presently available at
  \url{http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/}).
\end{quote}

The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by
the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see
section~\ref{sec:opl:options}).

Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
permitted.

Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the
citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and
author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all
outer surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as
large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to
the title.

\section{Copyright}

The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or
designee.

\section{Scope of license}

The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works,
unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.

Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall
not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate
work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open
Publication material and appropriate copyright notice.

\textbf{Severability}. If any part of this license is found to be
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the
license remain in force.

\textbf{No warranty}. Open Publication works are licensed and provided
``as is'' without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including,
but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.

\section{Requirements on modified works}

All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must
meet the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The modified version must be labeled as such.
\item The person making the modifications must be identified and the
  modifications dated.
\item Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if
  applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation
  practices.
\item The location of the original unmodified document must be
  identified.
\item The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to
  assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the
  original author's (or authors') permission.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Good-practice recommendations}

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
and strongly recommended of redistributors that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or
  CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent
  to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media
  freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This
  notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the
  document.
\item All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either
  clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment
  to the document.
\item Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
  considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM
  expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).
\end{enumerate}

\section{License options}
\label{sec:opl:options}

The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed
document may elect certain options by appending language to the
reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part
of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its
incorporation by reference) in derived works.

\begin{enumerate}[A]
\item To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions
  without the explicit permission of the author(s). ``Substantive
  modification'' is defined as a change to the semantic content of the
  document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical
  corrections.

  To accomplish this, add the phrase ``Distribution of substantively
  modified versions of this document is prohibited without the
  explicit permission of the copyright holder.'' to the license
  reference or copy.

\item To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in
  whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial
  purposes is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the
  copyright holder.

  To accomplish this, add the phrase ``Distribution of the work or
  derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is
  prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright
  holder.'' to the license reference or copy.
\end{enumerate}
