Smart middleware sitting in front of MySQL and serving clients
requests.

\begin{itemize}
\item Connection pooling.
\item SQL parser: Although very close, the vtocc SQL parser is not SQL-92
compliant. It has left out constructs that are deemed uncommon or
OLTP-unfriendly. It should, however, allow most queries used by a
well-behaved web application.
\item Query rewrite and sanitation (adding limits, avoiding non-deterministic updates).
\item Query consolidation: reuse the results of an in-flight query to any
subsequent requests that were received while the query was still
executing.
\item Rowcache: the mysql buffer cache is optimized for range scans over
indices and tables. Unfortunately, it’s not good for random access
by primary key. The rowcache will instead maintain a row based cache
(using \href{http://memcached.org/}{memcached} as its backend) and keep it
consistent by fielding all DMLs that could potentially affect them.
\item Update stream: A server that streams the list of rows that are changing
in the database, which can be used as a mechanism to continuously export
the data to another data store.
\item Integrated query killer for queries that take too long to return
data.
\item Discard idle backend connections to avoid offline db errors.
\item Transaction management: Ability to limit the number of concurrent
transactions and manage deadlines.
\end{itemize}
