## Github CI Workflows

This document has a short outline of how tests are run in CI, how to add new tests and where these are configured.

### Adding a new test

Unit tests are run by the unit test runner, one per platform, currently mysql57, mysql80.
The workflow first installs the required database server before calling `make unit_test`.

To add a new end-to-end (e2e) test (also called _cluster end to end_ tests):
* Add a new object to test/config.json
* If you are creating a new test _shard_:
  * update `clusterList` in `ci_workflow_gen.go`
  * `make generate_ci_workflows`
* If you are adding a new database platform, update the `templates\unit_test.tpl` to add 
  the platform specific packages and update `unitTestDatabases`


### Vitess test runner
The `.github/workflows` directory contains one yaml file per workflow. e2e tests are run using the `test.go` script 
in the repository root.

This script invokes the vitess e2e test framework using a json configuration file `test/config.json` which has one object per test. 
Each test is of the form:

```javascript
"vtgate": {
			"File": "unused.go",
			"Args": ["vitess.io/vitess/go/test/endtoend/vtgate"],
			"Command": [],
			"Manual": false,
			"Shard": 17,
			"RetryMax": 0,
			"Tags": []
		},
```
The important parameters here are Args which define the arguments to `go test` and the Shard which says 
which Test VM should run this test. All tests which have a common Shard value are run in the same test vm.

### Known Issue

* Each VM does not seem to be able to create a lot of vttablets. For this reason we have had to split a few VReplication 
e2e tests across Shards. We need to identify and if possible fix this limitation so that we can reduce the number of test Shards
