Package exit provides an alternative to os.Exit(int) that executes deferred
functions before exiting.

Defer a call to exit.Recover() or exit.RecoverAll() at the beginning of main().
Use exit.Return(int) to initiate an exit.

	func main() {
		defer exit.Recover()
		...
		f()
	}

	func f() {
		exit.Return(123)
	}

This package should only be used from the main goroutine.
