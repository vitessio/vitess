// RPCPool is a specialized version of the ResourcePool, for bounding concurrent
// access to making RPC calls.
//
// Whether you use this, or a sync2.Semaphore to gate RPCs (or shared access to
// any shared resource) depends on what timeout semantics you need. A sync2.Semaphore
// takes a global timeout, which applies to calls to Acquire(); if you need to
// respect a context's deadline, you can call AcquireContext(context.Context),
// but that ignores the global timeout. Conversely, an RPCPool provides only
// one method of acquisition, Acquire(context.Context), which always uses the
// lower of the pool-global timeout or the context deadline.

// will be used. If a logWait function is provided, it will be called whenever

// wait (meaning if we hit a timeout before a resource becomes available, it

// case the context deadline will always serve as the overall timeout.
