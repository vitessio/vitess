package sidecardb

/*

The sidecardb module is used to create and upgrade the _vt schema on tablet init.

The vtschema subdirectory has subdirectories, categorized by module, with one file per table in _vt. Each has the latest
schema for each table in _vt (in the form of a create table script).

sidecardb uses the schemadiff module in Vitess, originally created for online ddl, to reach the desired schema
for each table.
