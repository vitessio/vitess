/*
	VDiff gets data from multiple sources. There is a global ordering of all the data (based on PKs). However, that
	data is potentially spread across shards. The distribution is selected by the vindex (sharding key) and hence
	we need to globally sort the data across the shards to match the order on the target: we need the rows to be in
	order so that we can compare the data correctly.

	We leverage the merge sorting functionality that vtgate uses to return sorted data from a scatter query.
		* Merge sorter engine.Primitives are set up, one each for the source and target shards.
		* This merge sorter is embedded by a primitiveExecutor, which also contains a query result channel,
			and a list of rows, sorted for the specific shard. These rows have already been popped
			from the query result, but not yet compared since they do not yet contain the "topmost" row.
		* The result channel is populated by the shardStreamer, which satisfies the engine.StreamExecutor interface.
			The shardStreamer gets data using VStreamRows for that shard.
