// Package heartbeat contains a writer and reader of heartbeats for a master-slave cluster.
// This is similar to Percona's pt-heartbeat, and is meant to supplement the information
// returned from SHOW SLAVE STATUS. In some circumstances, lag returned from SHOW SLAVE STATUS
// is incorrect and is at best only at 1 second resolution. The heartbeat package directly
// tests replication by writing a record with a timestamp on the master, and comparing that
// timestamp after reading it on the slave. This happens at the interval defined by heartbeat_interval.
// Note: the lag reported will be affected by clock drift, so it is recommended to run ntpd or similar.
//
// The data collected by the heartbeat package is made available in /debug/vars in counters prefixed by Heartbeat*.
// It's additionally used as a source for healthchecks and will impact the serving state of a tablet, if enabled.
// The heartbeat interval is purposefully kept distinct from the health check interval because lag measurement
// requires more frequent polling that the healthcheck typically is configured for.
