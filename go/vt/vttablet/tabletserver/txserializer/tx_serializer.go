//
// This implementation has some parallels to the sync2.Consolidator class.
// However, there are many substantial differences:
// - Results are not shared between queued transactions.
// - Only one waiting transaction and not all are notified when the current one
//   has finished.
// - Waiting transactions are woken up in FIFO order.
// - Waiting transactions are unblocked if their context is done.
// - Both the local queue (per row range) and global queue (whole process) are
//   limited to avoid that queued transactions can consume the full capacity
//   of vttablet. This is important if the capaciy is finite. For example, the
//   number of RPCs in flight could be limited by the RPC subsystem.
