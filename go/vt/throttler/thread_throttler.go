// threadThrottler implements the core logic which decides if a Throttle() call
// should be throttled (and for how long) or not.
// It does so by splitting the time into 1 second intervals. For example,
// the current rate is based on the number of requests received within the
// current second.

	// If it gets updated, we won't consider it until the next second starts
	// because our throttler operates at a 1s granularity and doesn't support
	// changes within the same second.
	// For example in case of a steep rate increase at the end of the second,
	// it would let too many requests through for the remainder of the second:
	//   old rate = 10   (1 request every 100 ms)
	//   new rate = 1000 (1 request every   1 ms)
	//   milliseconds left in the second = 100 ms (i.e. 900 ms elapsed)

	//   => new rate would allow 991 more requests
