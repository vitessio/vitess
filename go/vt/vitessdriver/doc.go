// Package vitessdriver contains the Vitess Go SQL driver.
/*
Vitess

Vitess is an SQL middleware which turns MySQL/MariaDB into a fast, scalable and
highly-available distributed database.
For more information, visit http://www.vitess.io.


Example

Using this SQL driver is as simple as:

  import (
    "time"
    "github.com/youtube/vitess/go/vt/vitessdriver"
  )

  func main() {
    // Connect to vtgate (v1 mode).
    db, err := vitessdriver.Open("localhost:15991", "keyspace", "0", "master", 30*time.Second)

    // Use "db" via the Golang sql interface.
  }

For a full example, please see: https://github.com/youtube/vitess/blob/master/examples/local/client.go

The full example is based on our tutorial for running Vitess locally: http://vitess.io/getting-started/local-instance.html


Vtgate

This driver connects to a vtgate process. In Vitess, vtgate is a proxy server
that routes queries to the appropriate shards.

By decoupling the routing logic from the application, vtgate enables Vitess
features like consistent, application-transparent resharding:
When you scale up the number of shards, vtgate becomes aware of the new shards.
You do not have to update your application at all.

Another Vitess feature is the vtgate v3 API. Once enabled, a sharded Vitess
setup becomes a drop-in replacement for an unsharded MySQL/MariaDB setup.


Vtgate API Versions

This driver supports the vtgate API versions v1 and v3, but not v2.

We recommend you use the v1 API for initial experiments and then switch to v3
later because v3 requires an additional setup step.

The API versions differ as follows:


Vtgate API v1

v1 requires each query to specify the target shard. vtgate then routes the query
accordingly.

This driver supports the v1 API at the connection level. For example, to open a
Vitess database connection for queries targeting shard "0" in the keyspace
"test_keyspace", call:

  vitessdriver.OpenShard(vtgateAddress, "test_keyspace", "0", 30*time.Second)

This mode is recommended for initial experiments or when migrating from a
pure MySQL/MariaDB setup to an unsharded Vitess setup. For a sharded Vitess
setup we recommend to move to the v2 or v3 API because only these APIs are
agnostic of resharding events.


Vtgate API v2

v2 requires each query to specify the affected sharding keys ("keyspace_id").

Based on the provided sharding key, vtgate then routes the query to the shard
that currently covers that sharding key.

This driver currently does not support the v2 API because it's difficult to
enhance the Go SQL interface with the sharding key information at the
query-level.
Instead, it's recommended to use the v3 API.


Vtgate API v3

v3 automatically infers the sharding key (and therefore the target shard)
from the query itself.

It also maintains secondary indexes across shards and generates values for
AUTO_INCREMENT columns.

See the vtgate v3 Features doc for an overview:
https://github.com/youtube/vitess/blob/master/doc/VTGateV3Features.md

To enable vtgate v3, you need to create a VSchema. A VSchema defines for vtgate
the properties of your Vitess setup (e.g. what is the sharding key, which
cross-shard indexes should be maintained, what are the AUTO_INCREMENT columns).

As of 12/2015, the VSchema creation is not documented yet as we are in the
process of simplifying the VSchema definition and the overall process for
creating one.
If you want to create your own VSchema, we recommend to have a
look at the VSchema from the vtgate v3 demo:
https://github.com/youtube/vitess/blob/master/examples/demo/schema/vschema.json

(The demo itself is interactive and can be run by executing "./run.py" in the
"examples/demo/" directory.)

The vtgate v3 design doc, which we will also update and simplify in the future,
contains more details on the VSchema:
