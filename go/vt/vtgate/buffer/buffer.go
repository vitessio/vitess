// Package buffer provides a buffer for MASTER traffic during failovers.
//
// Instead of returning an error to the application (when the vttablet master
// becomes unavailable), the buffer will automatically retry buffered requests
// after the end of the failover was detected.
//
// Buffering (stalling) requests will increase the number of requests in flight
// within vtgate and at upstream layers. Therefore, it is important to limit
// the size of the buffer and the buffering duration (window) per request.
// See the file flags.go for the available configuration and its defaults.
