// Conn defines the interface that must be implemented by topology

//
// Zookeeper is a good example of an implementation, as defined in
// go/vt/topo/zk2topo.
//
// This API is very generic, and key/value store oriented.  We use
// regular paths for object names, and we can list all immediate
// children of a path. All paths sent through this API are relative
// paths, from the root directory of the cell.
//
// The Conn objects are created by the Factory implementations.

	// Directory support
	//

	// ListDir returns the entries in a directory.  The returned
	// list should be sorted by entry.Name.
	// If there are no files under the provided path, returns ErrNoNode.
	// dirPath is a path relative to the root directory of the cell.
	// If full is set, we want all the fields in DirEntry to be filled in.
	// If full is not set, only Name will be used. This is intended for
	// implementations where getting more than the names is more expensive,

	// Locks
	//

	// Lock takes a lock on the given directory.
	// It does not prevent any modification to any file in the topology.
	// It just prevents two concurrent processes (wherever they are)
	// to run concurrently. It is used for instance to make sure only
	// one reparent operation is running on a Shard at a given time.
	// dirPath is the directory associated with a resource, for instance
	// a Keyspace or a Shard. It is not a file location.
	// (this means the implementation can for instance create a
	// file in this directory to materialize the lock).
	// contents describes the lock holder and purpose, but has no other
	// meaning, so it can be used as a lock file contents, for instance.
	// Returns ErrNoNode if the directory doesn't exist (meaning
	//   there is no existing file under that directory).
	// Returns ErrTimeout if ctx expires.
	// Returns ErrInterrupted if ctx is canceled.
	Lock(ctx context.Context, dirPath, contents string) (LockDescriptor, error)

	// TryLock takes lock on the given directory with a fail-fast approach.
	// It is similar to `Lock` but the difference is it attempts to acquire the lock
	// if it is likely to succeed. If there is already a lock on given path, then unlike `Lock`
	// instead of waiting and blocking the client it returns with `Lock already exists` error.
	// With current implementation it may not be able to fail-fast for some scenarios.
	// For example there is a possibility that a thread checks for lock for a given path
	// but by the time it acquires the lock, some other thread has already acquired it,
	// in this case the client will block until the other caller releases the lock or the
	// client call times out (just like standard `Lock' implementation). In short the lock checking
	// and acquiring is not under the same mutex in current implementation of `TryLock`.
	TryLock(ctx context.Context, dirPath, contents string) (LockDescriptor, error)

	//
	// Watches
	//

	// Watch starts watching a file in the provided cell.  It
	// returns the current value, a 'changes' channel to read the
	// changes from, and an error.
	// If the initial read fails, or the file doesn't
	// exist, an error is returned.
	//
	// To stop the watch, cancel the provided context.
	// This will eventually result in a final WatchData result with Err =
	// ErrInterrupted. It should be safe to cancel the context
	// multiple times, or after the Watch already errored out.
	//
	// The 'changes' channel may return a record with Err != nil.
	// In that case, the channel will also be closed right after
	// that record.  In any case, 'changes' has to be drained of
	// all events, even when 'stop' is closed.
	//
	// Note the 'changes' channel can return twice the same
	// Version/Contents (for instance, if the watch is interrupted
	// and restarted within the Conn implementation).
	// Similarly, the 'changes' channel may skip versions / changes
	// (that is, if value goes [A, B, C, D, E, F], the watch may only
	// receive [A, B, F]). This should only happen for rapidly
	// changing values though. Usually, the initial value will come
	// back right away. And a stable value (that hasn't changed for
	// a while) should be seen shortly.
	//
	// The Watch call is not guaranteed to return exactly up to
	// date data right away. For instance, if a file is created
	// and saved, and then a watch is set on that file, it may
	// return ErrNoNode (as the underlying configuration service
	// may use asynchronous caches that are not up to date
	// yet). The only guarantee is that the watch data will
	// eventually converge. Vitess doesn't explicitly depend on the data
	// being correct quickly, as long as it eventually gets there.
