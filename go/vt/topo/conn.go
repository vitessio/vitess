// Conn defines the interface that must be implemented by topology
// plug-ins to be used with Vitess.
//
// Zookeeper is a good example of an implementation, as defined in
// go/vt/topo/zk2topo.
//
// This API is very generic, and key/value store oriented.  We use
// regular paths for object names, and we can list all immediate
// children of a path. All paths sent through this API are relative
// paths, from the root directory of the cell.
//
// The Conn objects are created by the Factory implementations.
type Conn interface {

	// Directory support
	//

	// ListDir returns the entries in a directory.  The returned
	// list should be sorted by entry.Name.
	// If there are no files under the provided path, returns ErrNoNode.
	// dirPath is a path relative to the root directory of the cell.
	// If full is set, we want all the fields in DirEntry to be filled in.
	// If full is not set, only Name will be used. This is intended for
	// implementations where getting more than the names is more expensive,
	// as in most cases only the names are needed.
	ListDir(ctx context.Context, dirPath string, full bool) ([]DirEntry, error)

	// File support
	// if version == nil, then itâ€™s an unconditional update / delete.

	// Returns ErrNodeExists if the file exists.
	// filePath is a path relative to the root directory of the cell.

	// Update updates the file with the provided filename with the
	// new content.
	// If version is nil, it is an unconditional update
	// (which is then the same as a Create is the file doesn't exist).
	// filePath is a path relative to the root directory of the cell.
	// It returns the new Version of the file after update.
	// Returns ErrBadVersion if the provided version is not current.
	Update(ctx context.Context, filePath string, contents []byte, version Version) (Version, error)

	// filePath is a path relative to the root directory of the cell.
	// Can return ErrNoNode if the file doesn't exist.
	Get(ctx context.Context, filePath string) ([]byte, Version, error)

	// Delete deletes the provided file.
	// If version is nil, it is an unconditional delete.
	// If the last entry of a directory is deleted, using ListDir
	// on its parent directory should not return the directory.
	// For instance, when deleting /keyspaces/aaa/Keyspace, and if
	// there is no other file in /keyspaces/aaa, then aaa should not
	// appear any more when listing /keyspaces.
	// filePath is a path relative to the root directory of the cell.
	//
	// Delete will never be called on a directory.
	// Returns ErrNodeExists if the file doesn't exist.
	// Returns ErrBadVersion if the provided version is not current.
	Delete(ctx context.Context, filePath string, version Version) error

	//
	// Locks
	//

	// Lock takes a lock on the given directory.
	// It does not prevent any modification to any file in the topology.
	// It just prevents two concurrent processes (wherever they are)
	// to run concurrently. It is used for instance to make sure only
	// one reparent operation is running on a Shard at a given time.
	// dirPath is the directory associated with a resource, for instance
	// a Keyspace or a Shard. It is not a file location.
	// (this means the implementation can for instance create a
	// file in this directory to materialize the lock).
	// contents describes the lock holder and purpose, but has no other
	// meaning, so it can be used as a lock file contents, for instance.
	// Returns ErrNoNode if the directory doesn't exist (meaning
	//   there is no existing file under that directory).
	// Returns ErrTimeout if ctx expires.
	// Returns ErrInterrupted if ctx is canceled.
	Lock(ctx context.Context, dirPath, contents string) (LockDescriptor, error)

	//
	// Watches
	//

	// Watch starts watching a file in the provided cell.  It
	// returns the current value, a 'changes' channel to read the
	// changes from, and a 'cancel' function to call to stop the
	// watch.  If the initial read fails, or the file doesn't
	// exist, current.Err is set, and 'changes'/'cancel' are nil.
	// Otherwise current.Err is nil, and current.Contents /
	// current.Version are accurate. The provided context is only
	// used to setup the current watch, and not after Watch()
	// returns.
	//
	// To stop the watch, just call the returned 'cancel' function.
	// This will eventually result in a final WatchData result with Err =
	// ErrInterrupted. It should be safe to call the 'cancel' function
	// multiple times, or after the Watch already errored out.
	//
	// The 'changes' channel may return a record with Err != nil.
	// In that case, the channel will also be closed right after
	// that record.  In any case, 'changes' has to be drained of
	// all events, even when 'stop' is closed.
	//
	// Note the 'changes' channel can return twice the same
	// Version/Contents (for instance, if the watch is interrupted
	// and restarted within the Conn implementation).
	// Similarly, the 'changes' channel may skip versions / changes
	// (that is, if value goes [A, B, C, D, E, F], the watch may only
	// receive [A, B, F]). This should only happen for rapidly
	// changing values though. Usually, the initial value will come
	// back right away. And a stable value (that hasn't changed for
	// a while) should be seen shortly.
	//
	// The Watch call is not guaranteed to return exactly up to
	// date data right away. For instance, if a file is created
	// and saved, and then a watch is set on that file, it may
	// return ErrNoNode (as the underlying configuration service
	// may use asynchronous caches that are not up to date
	// yet). The only guarantee is that the watch data will
	// eventually converge. Vitess doesn't explicitly depend on the data
	// being correct quickly, as long as it eventually gets there.

	// Master election methods. This is meant to have a small
	// number of processes elect a master within a group. The

	// reduce the load / dependency on the global topo server.

	// NewMasterParticipation creates a MasterParticipation
	// object, used to become the Master in an election for the
