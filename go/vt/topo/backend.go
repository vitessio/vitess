	// If version is nil, it is an unconditional update

	// It returns the new Version of the file after update.
	// Returns ErrBadVersion if the provided version is not current.

	// appear any more when listing /keyspaces.

	//
	// Watches
	//

	// Watch starts watching a file in the provided cell.  It
	// returns the current value, a 'changes' channel to read the
	// changes from, and a 'cancel' function to call to stop the
	// watch.  If the initial read fails, or the file doesn't
	// exist, current.Err is set, and 'changes'/'cancel' are nil.
	// Otherwise current.Err is nil, and current.Contents /
	// current.Version are accurate. The provided context is only
	// used to setup the current watch, and not after Watch()
	// returns.
	//
	// To stop the watch, just call the returned 'cancel' function.
	// This will eventually result in a final WatchData result with Err =
	// ErrInterrupted. It should be safe to call the 'cancel' function
	// multiple times, or after the Watch already errored out.
	//
	// The 'changes' channel may return a record with Err != nil.
	// In that case, the channel will also be closed right after
	// that record.  In any case, 'changes' has to be drained of
	// all events, even when 'stop' is closed.
	//
	// Note the 'changes' channel can return twice the same
	// Version/Contents (for instance, if the watch is interrupted
	// and restarted within the Backend implementation).
	// Similarly, the 'changes' channel may skip versions / changes
	// (that is, if value goes [A, B, C, D, E, F], the watch may only
	// receive [A, B, F]). This should only happen for rapidly
	// changing values though. Usually, the initial value will come
	// back right away. And a stable value (that hasn't changed for
	// a while) should be seen shortly.
	//
	// The Watch call is not guaranteed to return exactly up to
	// date data right away. For instance, if a file is created
	// and saved, and then a watch is set on that file, it may
	// return ErrNoNode (as the underlying configuration service
	// may use asynchronous caches that are not up to date
	// yet). The only guarantee is that the watch data will
	// eventually converge. Vitess doesn't explicitly depend on the data
	// being correct quickly, as long as it eventually gets there.

	// Err is set the same way for both the 'current' value
	// returned by Watch, or the values read on the 'changes'
	// channel. It can be:
	// - nil, then Contents and Version are set.
	// - ErrNoNode if the file doesn't exist.
	// - ErrInterrupted if 'cancel' was called.
	// - any other platform-specific error.
