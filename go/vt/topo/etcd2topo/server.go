Package etcd2topo implements topo.Server with etcd as the backend.

We expect the following behavior from the etcd client library:

  - Get and Delete return ErrorCodeKeyNotFound if the node doesn't exist.
  - Create returns ErrorCodeNodeExist if the node already exists.
  - Intermediate directories are always created automatically if necessary.
  - Set returns ErrorCodeKeyNotFound if the node doesn't exist already.
  - It returns ErrorCodeTestFailed if the provided version index doesn't match.

We follow these conventions within this package:

  - Call convertError(err) on any errors returned from the etcd client library.
    Functions defined in this package can be assumed to have already converted
    errors as necessary.
