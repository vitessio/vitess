// PersistChanges starts a background goroutine to persist changes made to the
// dynamic registry in-memory (i.e. the "live" config) back to disk (i.e. the
// "disk" config) are persisted back to disk. It returns a cancel func to stop
// the persist loop, which the caller is responsible for calling during
// shutdown (see package servenv for an example).
//
// This does two things â€” one which is a nice-to-have, and another which is
// necessary for correctness.
//
// 1. Writing in-memory changes (which usually occur through a request to a
// /debug/env endpoint) ensures they are persisted across process restarts.
// 2. Writing in-memory changes ensures that subsequent modifications to the
// config file do not clobber those changes. Because viper loads the entire
// config on-change, rather than an incremental (diff) load, if a user were to
// edit an unrelated key (keyA) in the file, and we did not persist the
// in-memory change (keyB), then future calls to keyB.Get() would return the
// older value.
