// TestIncrementalBackupAndRestoreToTimestamp - tests incremental backups and restores.
// The general outline of the test:
//   - Generate some schema with data
//   - Take a full backup
//   - Proceed to take a series of inremental backups. In between, inject data (insert rows), and keep record
//     of which data (number of rows) is present in each backup, and at which timestamp.
//   - Expect backups success/failure per scenario
//   - Next up, we start testing restores. Randomly pick recorded timestamps and restore to those points in time.
//   - In each restore, excpect to find the data (number of rows) recorded for said timestamp
//   - Some restores should fail because the timestamp exceeds the last binlog
//   - Do so for all recorded tiemstamps.
//   - Then, a 2nd round where some backups are purged -- this tests to see that we're still able to find a restore path
//     (of course we only delete backups that still leave us with valid restore paths).
//
// All of the above is done for BuiltinBackup, XtraBackup, Mysqlctld (which is technically builtin)
