This test simulates the first time a database has to be split.

- we start with a keyspace with a single shard and a single table
- we add and populate the sharding key
- we set the sharding key in the topology
- we clone into 2 instances
- we enable filtered replication
- we move all serving types
- we remove the source tablets
- we remove the original shard
