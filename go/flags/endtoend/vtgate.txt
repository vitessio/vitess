VTGate is a stateless proxy responsible for accepting requests from applications and routing them to the appropriate tablet server(s) for query execution. It speaks both the MySQL Protocol and a gRPC protocol.

### Key Options

* `--srv-topo-cache-ttl`: There may be instances where you will need to increase the cached TTL from the default of 1 second to a higher number:
	* You may want to increase this option if you see that your topo leader goes down and keeps your queries waiting for a few seconds.

Usage:
  vtgate [flags]

      --warming-reads-concurrency int                                    Number of concurrent warming reads allowed (default 500)
      --warming-reads-percent int                                        Percentage of reads on the primary to forward to replicas. Useful for keeping buffer pools warm
