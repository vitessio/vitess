zk is a tool for wrangling zookeeper.

It tries to mimic unix file system commands wherever possible, but
there are some slight differences in flag handling.

The zk tool looks for the address of the cluster in /etc/zookeeper/zk_client.conf,
or the file specified in the ZK_CLIENT_CONFIG environment variable.

The local cell may be overridden with the ZK_CLIENT_LOCAL_CELL environment
variable.

Usage:
  zk [command]

  addAuth
