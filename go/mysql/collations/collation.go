// Collation implements a MySQL-compatible collation. It defines how to compare
// for sorting order and equality two strings with the same encoding.
type Collation interface {
	// init initializes the internal state for the collation the first time it is used
	init()

	// Id returns the numerical identifier for this collation. This is the same
	// value that is returned by MySQL in a query's headers to identify the collation
	// for a given column
	Id() uint

	// Name is the full name of this collation, in the form of "ENCODING_LANG_SENSITIVITY"
	Name() string

	// Collate compares two strings using this collation. `left` and `right` must be the
	// two strings encoded in the proper encoding for this collation. If `isPrefix` is true,
	// the function instead behaves equivalently to `strings.HasPrefix(left, right)`, but
	// being collation-aware.
	// It returns a numeric value like a normal comparison function: <0 if left < right,
	// 0 if left == right, >0 if left > right
	Collate(left, right []byte, isPrefix bool) int

	// WeightString returns a weight string for the given `src` string. A weight string
	// is a binary representation of the weights for the given string, that can be
	// compared byte-wise to return identical results to collating this string.
	//
	// This means:
	//		bytes.Compare(WeightString(left), WeightString(right)) == Collate(left, right)
	//
	// The semantics of this API have been carefully designed to match MySQL's behavior
	// in its `strnxfrm` API. Most notably, the `numCodepoints` argument implies different
	// behaviors depending on the collation's padding mode:
	//
	// - For collations that pad WITH SPACE (this is, all legacy collations in MySQL except
	//	for the newly introduced UCA v9.0.0 utf8mb4 collations in MySQL 8.0), `numCodepoints`
	// 	can have the following values:
	//
	//		- if `numCodepoints` is any integer greater than zero, this treats the `src` string
	//		as if it were in a `CHAR(numCodepoints)` column in MySQL, meaning that the resulting
	//		weight string will be padded with the weight for the SPACE character until it becomes
	//		wide enough to fill the `CHAR` column. This is necessary to perform weight comparisons
	//		in fixed-`CHAR` columns. If `numCodepoints` is smaller than the actual amount of
	//		codepoints stored in `src`, the result is unspecified.
	//
	//		- if `numCodepoints` is zero, this is equivalent to `numCodepoints = RuneCount(src)`,
	//		meaning that the resulting weight string will have no padding at the end: it'll only have
	//		the weight values for the exact amount of codepoints contained in `src`. This is the
	//		behavior required to sort `VARCHAR` columns.
	//
	//		- if `numCodepoints` is the special constant PadToMax, then the `dst` slice must be
	//		pre-allocated to a zero-length slice with enough capacity to hold the complete weight
	//		string, and any remaining capacity in `dst` will be filled by the weights for the
	//		padding character, repeatedly. This is a special flag used by MySQL when performing
	//		filesorts, where all the sorting keys must have identical sizes, even for `VARCHAR`
	//		columns.
	//
	//	- For collations that have NO PAD (this is, the newly introduced UCA v9.0.0 utf8mb4 collations
	//	in MySQL 8.0), `numCodepoints` can only have the special constant `PadToMax`, which will make
	//	the weight string padding equivalent to a PAD SPACE collation (as explained in the previous
	//	section). All other values for `numCodepoints` are ignored, because NO PAD collations always
	//	return the weights for the codepoints in their strings, with no further padding at the end.
	//
	// The resulting weight string is written to `dst`, which can be pre-allocated to
	// WeightStringLen() bytes to prevent growing the slice. `dst` can also be nil, in which
	// case it will grow dynamically. If `numCodepoints` has the special PadToMax value explained
	// earlier, `dst` MUST be pre-allocated to the target size or the function will return an
	// empty slice.
	WeightString(dst, src []byte, numCodepoints int) []byte

	// WeightStringLen returns a size (in bytes) that would fit any weight strings for a string
	// with `numCodepoints` using this collation. Note that this is a higher bound for the size
	// of the string, and in practice weight strings can be significantly smaller than the
	// returned value.
