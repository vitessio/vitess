	// being collation-aware.

	// WeightString returns a weight string for the given `src` string. A weight string
	// is a binary representation of the weights for the given string, that can be

	// This means:
	//		bytes.Compare(WeightString(left), WeightString(right)) == Collate(left, right)
	//
	// The semantics of this API have been carefully designed to match MySQL's behavior
	// in its `strnxfrm` API. Most notably, the `numCodepoints` argument implies different
	// behaviors depending on the collation's padding mode:
	//
	// - For collations that pad WITH SPACE (this is, all legacy collations in MySQL except
	//	for the newly introduced UCA v9.0.0 utf8mb4 collations in MySQL 8.0), `numCodepoints`
	// 	can have the following values:
	//
	//		- if `numCodepoints` is any integer greater than zero, this treats the `src` string
	//		as if it were in a `CHAR(numCodepoints)` column in MySQL, meaning that the resulting
	//		weight string will be padded with the weight for the SPACE character until it becomes
	//		wide enough to fill the `CHAR` column. This is necessary to perform weight comparisons
	//		in fixed-`CHAR` columns. If `numCodepoints` is smaller than the actual amount of
	//		codepoints stored in `src`, the result is unspecified.
	//
	//		- if `numCodepoints` is zero, this is equivalent to `numCodepoints = RuneCount(src)`,
	//		meaning that the resulting weight string will have no padding at the end: it'll only have
	//		the weight values for the exact amount of codepoints contained in `src`. This is the
	//		behavior required to sort `VARCHAR` columns.
	//
	//		- if `numCodepoints` is the special constant PadToMax, then the `dst` slice must be
	//		pre-allocated to a zero-length slice with enough capacity to hold the complete weight
	//		string, and any remaining capacity in `dst` will be filled by the weights for the
	//		padding character, repeatedly. This is a special flag used by MySQL when performing
	//		filesorts, where all the sorting keys must have identical sizes, even for `VARCHAR`
	//		columns.
	//
	//	- For collations that have NO PAD (this is, the newly introduced UCA v9.0.0 utf8mb4 collations
	//	in MySQL 8.0), `numCodepoints` can only have the special constant `PadToMax`, which will make
	//	the weight string padding equivalent to a PAD SPACE collation (as explained in the previous
	//	section). All other values for `numCodepoints` are ignored, because NO PAD collations always
	//	return the weights for the codepoints in their strings, with no further padding at the end.
	//
	// The resulting weight string is written to `dst`, which can be pre-allocated to
	// WeightStringLen() bytes to prevent growing the slice. `dst` can also be nil, in which
	// case it will grow dynamically. If `numCodepoints` has the special PadToMax value explained
	// earlier, `dst` MUST be pre-allocated to the target size or the function will return an
	// empty slice.
	WeightString(dst, src []byte, numCodepoints int) []byte

	// WeightStringLen returns a size (in bytes) that would fit any weight strings for a string
	// with `numCodepoints` using this collation. Note that this is a higher bound for the size
	// of the string, and in practice weight strings can be significantly smaller than the
	// returned value.
	WeightStringLen(numCodepoints int) int

	// Hash returns a 32 or 64 bit identifier (depending on the platform) that uniquely identifies
	// the given string based on this collation. It is functionally equivalent to calling WeightString
	// and then hashing the result.
	//
	// Consequently, if the hashes for two strings are different, then the two strings are considered
	// different according to this collation. If the hashes for two strings are equal, the two strings
	// may or may not be considered equal according to this collation, because hashes can collide unlike
	// weight strings.
	//
	// The numCodepoints argument has the same behavior as in WeightString: if this collation uses PAD SPACE,
	// the hash will interpret the source string as if it were stored in a `CHAR(n)` column. If the value of
	// numCodepoints is 0, this is equivalent to setting `numCodepoints = RuneCount(src)`.
	// For collations with NO PAD, the numCodepoint argument is ignored.

	// Wildcard returns a matcher for the given wildcard pattern. The matcher can be used to repeatedly
	// test different strings to check if they match the pattern. The pattern must be a traditional wildcard

	// The provided `escape` character will be used as an escape sequence in front of the other special characters.
	//
	// This method is fully collation aware; the matching will be performed according to the underlying collation.
	// I.e. if this is a case-insensitive collation, matching will be case-insensitive.
	//
	// The returned WildcardPattern is always valid, but if the provided special characters do not exist in this
	// collation's repertoire, the returned pattern will not match any strings. Likewise, if the provided pattern
	// has invalid syntax, the returned pattern will not match any strings.
	//
	// If the provided special characters are 0, the defaults to parse an SQL 'LIKE' statement will be used.
	// This is, '_' for matching one character, '%' for matching many and '\\' for escape.
	//
	// This method can also be used for Shell-like matching with '?', '*' and '\\' as their respective special
