// the tables used as a reference can be found in `testdata/year_to_daynr.json`.
// It is worth noting that this absolute day number does not match the
// day count that traditional datetime systems use (e.g. the daycount
// algorithm in the Go standard library). It is often off by one, possibly
// because of incorrect leap year handling, but the inverse of the algorithm
// in mysqlDateFromDayNumber takes this into account. Hence, the results
// of this function can ONLY be passed to mysqlDateFromDayNumber; using
// a day number with one of Go's datetime APIs will return incorrect results.
// This API should only be used when performing datetime calculations (addition
// and subtraction), so that the results match MySQL's. All other date handling
// operations must use our helpers based on Go's standard library.
