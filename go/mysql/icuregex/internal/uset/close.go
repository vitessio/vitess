	 * match all except 'a', 'A', 'b', and 'B'. This performs a full
	 * closure over case mappings, e.g. U+017F for s.
	 *
	 * The resulting set is a superset of the input for the code points but
	 * not for the strings.
	 * It performs a case mapping closure of the code points and adds
	 * full case folding strings for the code points, and reduces strings of
	 * the original set to their full case folding equivalents.
	 *
	 * This is designed for case-insensitive matches, for example
	 * in regular expressions. The full code point case closure allows checking of
	 * an input character directly against the closure set.
	 * Strings are matched by comparing the case-folded form from the closure
	 * set with an incremental case folding of the string in question.
	 *
	 * The closure set will also contain single code points if the original
	 * set contained case-equivalent strings (like U+00DF for "ss" or "Ss" etc.).
	 * This is not necessary (that is, redundant) for the above matching method
	 * but results in the same closure sets regardless of whether the original
	 * set contained the code point or a string.
