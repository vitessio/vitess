// GTIDSet represents the set of transactions received or applied by a server.
// In some flavors, a single GTID is enough to specify the set of all
// transactions that came before it, but in others a more complex structure is
// required.
//
// GTIDSet is wrapped by replication.Position, which is a concrete struct.
// When sending a GTIDSet over RPCs, encode/decode it as a string.
// Most code outside of this package should use replication.Position rather
// than GTIDSet.

	// particular flavor of MySQL.
