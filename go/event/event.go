Package event provides a reflect-based framework for low-frequency global
dispatching of events, which are values of any arbitrary type, to a set of
listener functions, which are usually registered by plugin packages during init().

Listeners should do work in a separate goroutine if it might block. Dispatch
should be called synchronously to make sure work enters the listener's work
queue before moving on. After Dispatch returns, the listener is responsible for
arranging to flush its work queue before program termination if desired.

For example, any package can define an event type:

	package mypackage

	type MyEvent struct {
		field1, field2 string
	}

Then, any other package (e.g. a plugin) can listen for those events:

	package myplugin

	import (
		"event"
		"mypackage"
	)

	func onMyEvent(ev mypackage.MyEvent) {
		// do something with ev
	}

	func init() {
		event.AddListener(onMyEvent)
	}

Any registered listeners that accept a single argument of type MyEvent will
be called when a value of type MyEvent is dispatched:

	package myotherpackage

	import (
		"event"
		"mypackage"
	)

	func InMediasRes() {
		ev := mypackage.MyEvent{
			field1: "foo",
			field2: "bar",
		}

		event.Dispatch(ev)
	}

In addition, listener functions that accept an interface type will be called
for any dispatched value that implements the specified interface. A listener
that accepts interface{} will be called for every event type. Listeners can also
accept pointer types, but they will only be called if the dispatch site calls
Dispatch() on a pointer.
