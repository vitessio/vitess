# Ideally we would match two levels deep so we can un-ignore specific repos
# like launchpad.net/gozk, but doing that triggers a bug in "git stash".
# As a workaround, we ignore at the domain level.

# We really only want to un-ignore launchpad.net/gozk,
# because it has local, tracked changes.
# But we can't do that because of the bug mentioned above,
# so we un-ignore all of launchpad.net.
