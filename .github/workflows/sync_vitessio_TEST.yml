name: Sync Vitessio TEST

### This is just a test workflow.
### We just want a temporary workflow that can be run on push to verify access etc.
### Currently we are running into problems with auth and GITHUB_TOKEN.
### Once we have auth sorted, and can run this, we will delete this file and submit the non-test workflow.
