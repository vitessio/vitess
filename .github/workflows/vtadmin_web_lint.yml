      # Using "if: always()" means each step will run, even if a previous
      # step fails. This is nice because, for example, we want stylelint and 
      # prettier to run even if eslint fails. 
      #
      # An undesirable secondary effect of this is these steps
      # will run even if the install, etc. steps fail, which is... weird.
      # A nice enhancement is to parallelize these steps into jobs, with the
      # trade-off of more complexity around sharing npm install artifacts.
