1. First we get all _vt.vreplication streams, for all workflows.
1. Each shard has every workflow, with the same name, but potentially different values and counts of `id`.
1. After getting this, we want to get all `id` values for a shard, and go get `_vt.copy_state` with those `id`.
1. We then need to map those results back to streams organized by workflow.

results map[tablet][]row = VExec('select * from _vt.vreplication')

for tablet, qr = range results {
  vreplIds []int64
  for _, row := qr.Rows {
    id = qr[...]
    vreplIds = append(vreplIds, id)

    workflow = qr[...]
  }

  go func() {
    copyStatesById = getCopyState(tablet, vreplIds)
  }
}
