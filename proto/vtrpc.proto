// CallerID is passed along RPCs to identify the originating client
// for a request. It is not meant to be secure, but only
// informational.  The client can put whatever info they want in these
// fields, and they will be trusted by the servers. The fields will
// just be used for logging purposes, and to easily find a client.
// VtGate propagates it to VtTablet, and VtTablet may use this
// information for monitoring purposes, to display on dashboards, or
// for blacklisting purposes.
message CallerID {
  // principal is the effective user identifier. It is usually filled in
  // with whoever made the request to the appserver, if the request
  // came from an automated job or another system component.
  // If the request comes directly from the Internet, or if the Vitess client
  // takes action on its own accord, it is okay for this field to be absent.
  string principal = 1;

  // component describes the running process of the effective caller.
  // It can for instance be the hostname:port of the servlet initiating the
  // database call, or the container engine ID used by the servlet.

  // subcomponent describes a component inisde the immediate caller which
  // is responsible for generating is request. Suggested values are a
  // servlet name or an API endpoint name.

// ErrorCode is the enum values for Errors. Internally, errors should
// be created with one of these codes. These will then be translated over the wire
// by various RPC frameworks.
enum ErrorCode {
  // SUCCESS is returned from a successful call.
  SUCCESS = 0;

  // CANCELLED means that the context was cancelled (and noticed in the app layer,
  // as opposed to the RPC layer).
  CANCELLED = 1;

  // UNKNOWN_ERROR includes:
  // 1. MySQL error codes that we don't explicitly handle.
  // 2. MySQL response that wasn't as expected. For example, we might expect a MySQL
  //  timestamp to be returned in a particular way, but it wasn't.
  // 3. Anything else that doesn't fall into a different bucket.
  UNKNOWN_ERROR = 2;

  // BAD_INPUT is returned when an end-user either sends SQL that couldn't be parsed correctly,
  // or tries a query that isn't supported by Vitess.
  BAD_INPUT = 3;

  // DEADLINE_EXCEEDED is returned when an action is taking longer than a given timeout.

  // duplicate primary keys.

  // that they don't have permissions for.
  PERMISSION_DENIED = 6;

  // RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED is returned when a query exceeds its quota in some dimension
  // and can't be completed due to that. Queries that return RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
  // should not be retried, as it could be detrimental to the server's health.
  // Examples of errors that will cause the RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED code:
  // 1. TxPoolFull: this is retried server-side, and is only returned as an error
  //  if the server-side retries failed.
  // 2. Query is killed due to it taking too long.
  RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED = 7;

  // QUERY_NOT_SERVED means that a query could not be served right now.
  // Client can interpret it as: "the tablet that you sent this query to cannot
  // serve the query right now, try a different tablet or try again later."
  // This could be due to various reasons: QueryService is not serving, should
  // not be serving, wrong shard, wrong tablet type, blacklisted table, etc.
  // Clients that receive this error should usually retry the query, but after taking
  // the appropriate steps to make sure that the query will get sent to the correct
  // tablet.

  // INTERNAL_ERRORs are problems that only the server can fix, not the client.
  // These errors are not due to a query itself, but rather due to the state of
  // the system.
  // Generally, we don't expect the errors to go away by themselves, but they
  // may go away after human intervention.
  // Examples of scenarios where INTERNAL_ERROR is returned:
  //  1. Something is not configured correctly internally.
  //  2. A necessary resource is not available, and we don't expect it to become available by itself.
  //  3. A sanity check fails.
  //  4. Some other internal error occurs.
  // Clients should not retry immediately, as there is little chance of success.
  // However, it's acceptable for retries to happen internally, for example to
  // multiple backends, in case only a subset of backend are not functional.
  INTERNAL_ERROR = 10;

  // TRANSIENT_ERROR is used for when there is some error that we expect we can
  // recover from automatically - often due to a resource limit temporarily being
  // reached. Retrying this error, with an exponential backoff, should succeed.
  // Clients should be able to successfully retry the query on the same backends.
  // Examples of things that can trigger this error:
  // 1. Query has been throttled
  // 2. VtGate could have request backlog
  TRANSIENT_ERROR = 11;

  // UNAUTHENTICATED errors are returned when a user requests access to something,
  // and we're unable to verify the user's authentication.

}

// RPCError is an application-level error structure returned by
// VtTablet (and passed along by VtGate if appropriate).
// We use this so the clients don't have to parse the error messages,
// but instead can depend on the value of the code.
