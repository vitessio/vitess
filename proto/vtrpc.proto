// CallerID is passed along RPCs to identify the originating client

// informational.  The client can put whatever info they want in these
// fields, and they will be trusted by the servers. The fields will
// just be used for logging purposes, and to easily find a client.
// VtGate propagates it to VtTablet, and VtTablet may use this
// information for monitoring purposes, to display on dashboards, or
// for blacklisting purposes.

  // UNKNOWN error. An example of where this error may be returned is
  // if a Status value received from another address space belongs to
  // an error-space that is not known in this address space. Also
  // errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
  // may be converted to this error.
  UNKNOWN = 2;

  // INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates client specified an invalid argument.

  // that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
  // (e.g., a malformed file name).
  INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3;

  // DEADLINE_EXCEEDED means operation expired before completion.
  // For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be

  // already exists.

  // PERMISSION_DENIED indicates the caller does not have permission to
  // execute the specified operation. It must not be used for rejections
  // caused by exhausting some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
  // instead for those errors).  It must not be
  // used if the caller cannot be identified (use Unauthenticated

  // FAILED_PRECONDITION indicates operation was rejected because the
  // system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.
  // For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir
  // operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
  //
  // A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
  // between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
  //  (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
  //  (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
  //      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
  //  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
  //      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
  //      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
  //      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
  //      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
  //  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
  //      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
  //      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
  //      read-modify-write on the same resource.

  // ABORTED indicates the operation was aborted, typically due to a

  // ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.

  // OUT_OF_RANGE means operation was attempted past the valid range.
  // E.g., seeking or reading past end of file.
  //
  // Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may
  // be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
  // system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
  // offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
  // OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
  // file size.
  //
  // There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
  // OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
  // error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
  // a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when
  // they are done.

// the grpc error codes are fairly generic and mostly sufficient.

  // Examples of errors that will cause the RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED code:

  // This could be due to various reasons: QueryService is not serving, should
  // not be serving, wrong shard, wrong tablet type, blacklisted table, etc.

  // reached. Retrying this error, with an exponential backoff, should succeed.

  // 1. Query has been throttled
  // 2. VtGate could have request backlog
