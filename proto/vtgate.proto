  //    max are the minimum and maximum values of the split column in
  //    the table-shard, respectively, and partitioning it into 'split_count'
  //    sub-intervals of equal size. The added WHERE clause of each query-part

  //    distribution of values of the split column be uniform in [min, max]
  //    for the number of rows returned by each query part to be roughly the
  //    same.

  //    If this algorithm is used then the split_column must be the primary key

  //    in 'query' to get "boundary" rows that are num_rows_per_query_part
  //    apart when the table is ordered by the columns listed in
  //    'split_column'. It then restricts each query-part to the rows
