## <a id="major-changes"/>Major Changes</a>

### <a id="rpc-changes"/>RPC Changes</a>

These are the RPC changes made in this release - 

1. `GetTransactionInfo` RPC has been added to both `VtctldServer`, and `TabletManagerClient` interface. These RPCs are used to facilitate the users in reading the state of an unresolved distributed transaction. This can be useful in debugging what went wrong and how to fix the problem.

### <a id="deprecations-and-deletions"/>Deprecations and Deletions</a>

#### <a id="vttablet-flags"/>Deprecated VTTablet Flags</a>

- `twopc_enable` flag is deprecated. Usage of TwoPC commit will be determined by the `transaction_mode` set on VTGate via flag or session variable.

#### <a id="ghost-ptosc"/>Removing gh-ost and pt-osc Online DDL strategies</a>

Vitess no longer recognizes the `gh-ost` and `pt-osc` (`pt-online-schema-change`) Online DDL strategies. The `vitess` strategy is the recommended way to make schema changes at scale. `mysql` and `direct` strategies continue to be supported.

These `vttablet` flags have been removed:

- `--gh-ost-path`
- `--pt-osc-path`

The use of `gh-ost` and `pt-osc` as strategies as follows, yields an error:
```sh
$ vtctldclient ApplySchema --ddl-strategy="gh-ost" ...
$ vtctldclient ApplySchema --ddl-strategy="pt-osc" ...
```

### <a id="reparents-prefer-not-backing-up"/>Prefer not promoting a replica that is currently taking a backup

Emergency reparents now prefer not promoting replicas that are currently taking backups with a backup engine other than
`builtin`. Note that if there's only one suitable replica to promote, and it is taking a backup, it will still be
promoted.

For planned reparents, hosts taking backups with a backup engine other than `builtin` are filtered out of the list of
valid candidates. This means they will never get promoted - not even if there's no other candidates.

Note that behavior for `builtin` backups remains unchanged: a replica that is currently taking a `builtin` backup will
never be promoted, neither by planned nor by emergency reparents.

### <a id="vtorc-config-file-changes"/>VTOrc Config File Changes</a>

The configuration file for VTOrc has been updated to now support dynamic fields. The old `--config` parameter has been removed. The alternative is to use the `--config-file` parameter. The configuration can now be provided in json, yaml or any other format that [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) supports.

The following fields can be dynamically changed - 
1. `instance-poll-time`
2. `prevent-cross-cell-failover`
3. `snapshot-topology-interval`
4. `reasonable-replication-lag`
5. `audit-to-backend`
6. `audit-to-syslog`
7. `audit-purge-duration`
8. `wait-replicas-timeout`
9. `tolerable-replication-lag`
10. `topo-information-refresh-duration`
11. `recovery-poll-duration`
12. `allow-emergency-reparent`
13. `change-tablets-with-errant-gtid-to-drained`

To upgrade to the newer version of the configuration file, first switch to using the flags in your current deployment before upgrading. Then you can switch to using the configuration file in the newer release.

### <a id="vtgate-config-file-changes"/>VTGate Config File Changes</a>

The Viper configuration keys for the following flags has been changed to match their flag names. Previously they had a discovery prefix instead of it being part of the name. 

| Flag Name                                        | Old Configuration Key                            | New Configuration Key                            |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `discovery_low_replication_lag`                  | `discovery.low_replication_lag`                  | `discovery_low_replication_lag`                  |
| `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` | `discovery.high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` | `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` |
| `discovery_min_number_serving_vttablets`         | `discovery.min_number_serving_vttablets`         | `discovery_min_number_serving_vttablets`         |
| `discovery_legacy_replication_lag_algorithm`     | `discovery.legacy_replication_lag_algorithm`     | `discovery_legacy_replication_lag_algorithm`     |

To upgrade to the newer version of the configuration keys, first switch to using the flags in your current deployment before upgrading. Then you can switch to using the new configuration keys in the newer release.

### <a id="efficient-json-replication"/>Support for More Efficient JSON Replication</a>

In [#7345](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17345) we added support for [`--binlog-row-value-options=PARTIAL_JSON`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_value_options). You can read more about [this feature added to MySQL 8.0 here](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/efficient-json-replication-in-mysql-8-0/).

If you are using MySQL 8.0 or later and using JSON columns, you can now enable this MySQL feature across your Vitess cluster(s) to lower the disk space needed for binary logs and improve the CPU and memory usage in both `mysqld` (standard intrashard MySQL replication) and `vttablet` ([VReplication](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vreplication/)) without losing any capabilities or features.

### <a id="last-insert-id"/>Support for `LAST_INSERT_ID(x)`</a>

In [#17408](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17408) and [#17409](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17409), we added the ability to use `LAST_INSERT_ID(x)` in Vitess directly at vtgate. This improvement allows certain queries—like `SELECT last_insert_id(123);` or `SELECT last_insert_id(count(*)) ...`—to be handled without relying on MySQL for the final value.

**Limitations**:
- When using `LAST_INSERT_ID(x)` in ordered queries (e.g., `SELECT last_insert_id(col) FROM table ORDER BY foo`), MySQL sets the session’s last-insert-id value according to the *last row returned*. Vitess does not guarantee the same behavior.

### <a id="max-idle-connections"/>Support for Maximum Idle Connections in the Pool</a>

In [#17443](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17443) we introduced a new configurable max-idle-count parameter for connection pools. This allows you to specify the maximum number of idle connections retained in each connection pool to optimize performance and resource efficiency.

You can control idle connection retention for the query server’s query pool, stream pool, and transaction pool with the following flags:
•	--queryserver-config-query-pool-max-idle-count: Defines the maximum number of idle connections retained in the query pool.
•	--queryserver-config-stream-pool-max-idle-count: Defines the maximum number of idle connections retained in the stream pool.
•	--queryserver-config-txpool-max-idle-count: Defines the maximum number of idle connections retained in the transaction pool.

This feature ensures that, during traffic spikes, idle connections are available for faster responses, while minimizing overhead in low-traffic periods by limiting the number of idle connections retained. It helps strike a balance between performance, efficiency, and cost.

### <a id="stall-disk-recovery"/>Stalled Disk Recovery in VTOrc</a>
VTOrc can now identify and recover from stalled disk errors. VTTablets test whether the disk is writable and they send this information in the full status output to VTOrc. If the disk is not writable on the primary tablet, VTOrc will attempt to recover the cluster by promoting a new primary. This is useful in scenarios where the disk is stalled and the primary vttablet is unable to accept writes because of it.

To opt into this feature, `--enable-primary-disk-stalled-recovery` flag has to be specified on VTOrc, and `--disk-write-dir` flag has to be specified on the vttablets. `--disk-write-interval` and `--disk-write-timeout` flags can be used to configure the polling interval and timeout respectively. 

### <a id="mysql-8-0-40"/>Update default MySQL version to 8.0.40</a>

The default major MySQL version used by our `vitess/lite:latest` image is going from `8.0.30` to `8.0.40`.
This change was brought by [Pull Request #17552](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17552).

VTGate also advertises MySQL version `8.0.40` by default instead of `8.0.30` if no explicit version is set. The users can set the `mysql_server_version` flag to advertise the correct version.

#### <a id="upgrading-to-this-release-with-vitess-operator"/>⚠️Upgrading to this release with vitess-operator

If you are using the `vitess-operator`, considering that we are bumping the patch version of MySQL 80 from `8.0.30` to `8.0.40`, you will have to manually upgrade:

1. Add `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` to your extra cnf in your YAML file.
2. Apply this file.
3. Wait for all the pods to be healthy.
4. Then change your YAML file to use the new Docker Images (`vitess/lite:v22.0.0`).
5. Remove `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` from your extra cnf in your YAML file.
6. Apply this file.

This is the last time this will be needed in the `8.0.x` series, as starting with MySQL `8.0.35` it is possible to upgrade and downgrade between `8.0.x` versions without needing to run `innodb_fast_shutdown=0`.

### <a id="debian-bookworm"/>Update lite images to Debian Bookworm</a>

The base system now uses Debian Bookworm instead of Debian Bullseye for the `vitess/lite` images. This change was brought by [Pull Request #17552].

### <a id="key-range-vtorc"/>KeyRanges in `--clusters_to_watch` in VTOrc</a>
VTOrc now supports specifying keyranges in the `--clusters_to_watch` flag. This means that there is no need to restart a VTOrc instance with a different flag value when you reshard a keyspace.
For example, if a VTOrc is configured to watch `ks/-80`, then it would watch all the shards that fall under the keyrange `-80`. If a reshard is performed and `-80` is split into new shards `-40` and `40-80`, the VTOrc instance will automatically start watching the new shards without needing a restart. In the previous logic, specifying `ks/-80` for the flag would mean that VTOrc would watch only 1 (or no) shard. In the new system, since we interpret `-80` as a key range, it can watch multiple shards as described in the example.
Users can continue to specify exact keyranges. The new feature is backward compatible.

### <a id="query-logs"/>Support for Filtering Query logs on Error</a>

The `querylog-mode` setting can be configured to `error` to log only queries that result in errors. This option is supported in both VTGate and VTTablet.

## <a id="minor-changes"/>Minor Changes</a>

#### <a id="flags-vttablet"/>VTTablet Flags</a>

- `twopc_abandon_age` flag now supports values in the time.Duration format (e.g., 1s, 2m, 1h). 
While the flag will continue to accept float values (interpreted as seconds) for backward compatibility, 
**float inputs are deprecated** and will be removed in a future release.

- `--consolidator-query-waiter-cap` flag to set the maximum number of clients allowed to wait on the consolidator. The default value is set to 0 for unlimited wait. Users can adjust  this value based on the performance of VTTablet to avoid excessive memory usage and the risk of being OOMKilled, particularly in Kubernetes deployments.

#### <a id="reloading-vttablet-acl"/>VTTablet ACL enforcement and reloading</a>

When a tablet is started with `--enforce-tableacl-config` it will exit with an error if the contents of the file are not valid. After the changes made in https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17485 the tablet will no longer exit when reloading the contents of the file after receiving a SIGHUP. When the file contents are invalid on reload the tablet will now log an error and the active in-memory ACLs remain in effect.

### <a id="topo-read-concurrency-changes"/>`--topo_read_concurrency` behaviour changes

The `--topo_read_concurrency` flag was added to all components that access the topology and the provided limit is now applied separately for each global or local cell _(default `32`)_.

All topology read calls _(`Get`, `GetVersion`, `List` and `ListDir`)_ now respect this per-cell limit. Previous to this version a single limit was applied to all cell calls and it was not respected by many topology calls.

### <a id="vtadmin"/>VTAdmin

#### <a id="updated-node"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v22.13.1 (LTS)

Building `vtadmin-web` now requires node >= v22.13.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v20 to v22 can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.13.0 -- with no known issues that apply to VTAdmin.
Full details on the node v20.12.2 release can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.13.1.
