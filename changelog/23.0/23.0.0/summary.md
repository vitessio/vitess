#### <a id="upgrade-to-mysql-8.4"/>Upgrade to MySQL 8.4</a>

The default major MySQL version used by our `vitess/lite:latest` image is going from `8.0.40` to `8.4.6`.
This change was merged in [#18569](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18569).

VTGate also advertises MySQL version `8.4.6` by default instead of `8.0.40`. If that is not what you are running, you can set the `mysql_server_version` flag to advertise the desired version.

>  ⚠️ Upgrading to this release with vitess-operator:
>
> If you are using the `vitess-operator`, considering that we are bumping the MySQL version from `8.0.40` to `8.4.6`, you will have to manually upgrade:
>
> 1. Add `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` to your extra cnf in your YAML file.
> 2. Apply this file.
> 3. Wait for all the pods to be healthy.
> 4. Then change your YAML file to use the new Docker Images (`vitess/lite:v23.0.0`).
> 5. Remove `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` from your extra cnf in your YAML file.
> 6. Apply this file.
>
> This is only needed once when going from the latest `8.0.x` to `8.4.x`. Once you're on `8.4.x`, it is possible to upgrade and downgrade between `8.4.x` versions without needing to run `innodb_fast_shutdown=0`.

#### <a id="consul_auth_static_file-check-creds"/>`--consul_auth_static_file` requires 1 or more credentials</a>

The `--consul_auth_static_file` flag used in several components now requires that 1 or more credentials can be loaded from the provided json file.

### <a id="minor-changes-vtorc"/>VTOrc</a>

#### <a id="vtorc-dynamic-ers-disabled"/>Dynamic control of `EmergencyReparentShard`-based recoveries</a>

**Note: disabling `EmergencyReparentShard`-based recoveries introduces availability risks; please use with extreme caution! If you rely on this functionality often, for example in automation, this may be signs of an anti-pattern. If so, please open an issue to discuss supporting your use case natively in VTOrc.**

The new `vtctldclient` RPC `SetVtorcEmergencyReparent` was introduced to allow VTOrc recoveries involving `EmergencyReparentShard` actions to be disabled on a per-keyspace and/or per-shard basis. Previous to this version, disabling EmergencyReparentShard-based recoveries was only possible globally/per-VTOrc-instance. VTOrc will now consider this keyspace/shard-level setting that is refreshed from the topo on each recovery. The disabled state is determined by first checking if the keyspace, and then the shard state. Removing a keyspace-level override does not remove per-shard overrides.

To provide observability of keyspace/shards with EmergencyReparentShard-based VTOrc recoveries disabled, the `EmergencyReparentShardDisabled` metric was added. This metric label can be used to create alerting to ensure EmergencyReparentShard-based recoveries are not disabled for an undesired period of time.

#### <a id="recoveries-stats-keyspace-shard">Recovery stats to include keyspace/shard</a>

The following recovery-related stats now include labels for keyspaces and shards:
1. `FailedRecoveries`
2. `PendingRecoveries`
3. `RecoveriesCount`
4. `SuccessfulRecoveries`

Previous to this release, only the recovery "type" was included in labels.

### <a id="minor-changes-vttablet"/>VTTablet</a>

#### <a id="flags-vttablet"/>CLI Flags</a>

- `skip-user-metrics` flag if enabled, replaces the username label with "UserLabelDisabled" to prevent metric explosion in environments with many unique users.

#### <a id="mysql-caching-sha2-password"/>Managed MySQL configuration defaults to caching-sha2-password</a>

The default authentication plugin for MySQL 8.0.26 and later is now `caching_sha2_password` instead of `mysql_native_password`. This change is made because `mysql_native_password` is deprecated and removed in future MySQL versions. `mysql_native_password` is still enabled for backwards compatibility.

This change specifically affects the replication user. If you have a user configured with an explicit password, it is recommended to make sure to upgrade this user after upgrading to v23 with a statement like the following:

```sql
ALTER USER 'vt_repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'your-existing-password';
```

In future Vitess versions, the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin will be disabled for managed MySQL instances.

#### <a id="mysql-timezone-env"/>MySQL timezone environment propagation</a>

Fixed a bug where environment variables like `TZ` were not propagated from mysqlctl to the mysqld process.
As a result, timezone settings from the environment were previously ignored. Now mysqld correctly inherits environment variables.
⚠️ Deployments that relied on the old behavior and explicitly set a non-UTC timezone may see changes in how DATETIME values are interpreted. To preserve compatibility, set `TZ=UTC` explicitly in MySQL pods.

### <a id="docker"/>Docker</a>

[Bullseye went EOL 1 year ago](https://www.debian.org/releases/), so starting from v23, we will no longer build or publish images based on debian:bullseye.

Builds will continue for Debian Bookworm, and add the recently released Debian Trixie. v23 explicitly does not change the default Debian tag to Trixie.
