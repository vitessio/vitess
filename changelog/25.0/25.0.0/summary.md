#### <a id="vreplication-reverse-workflow-data-protection"/>Default data protection for `_reverse` workflow cancel/complete</a>

When calling `cancel` or `complete` on an auto-generated `_reverse` workflow without explicitly providing `--keep-data=false`, the system now defaults to keeping data and returns a warning. This prevents accidental deletion of production tables on the original source side, where the `_reverse` workflow's target is actually your production keyspace.

**Behavior change:**

| Workflow type | `--keep-data` flag | Effective `keep_data` | Warning emitted |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Normal       | omitted           | `false`              | No              |
| `_reverse`   | omitted           | `true`               | **Yes** |
| `_reverse`   | `--keep-data=false` | `false`            | No              |

The `--keep-data` flag help text has been updated to note this default explicitly. This change applies to MoveTables, Reshard, and other VReplication workflow types that use the shared cancel/complete paths.

See [#19906](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19906) for details.

### <a id="minor-changes-vtgate"/>VTGate</a>

#### <a id="vtgate-cross-keyspace-reads"/>New controls for cross-keyspace reads</a>

VTGate now supports preventing cross-keyspace reads (joins and UNIONs), preventing queries that would combine data from different keyspaces. This can be configured at two levels:

**VTGate flag** (applies to all queries):

```
--prevent-cross-keyspace-reads
```

**Per-keyspace VSchema setting** (applies to specific keyspaces):

```bash
vtctldclient ApplyVSchema --vschema='{"prevent_cross_keyspace_reads": true}' my_keyspace
```

When enabled, the planner will reject queries that require joining or combining (via UNION) tables from different keyspaces. This can be overridden on a per-query basis using the `ALLOW_CROSS_KEYSPACE_READS` comment directive:

```sql
/*vt+ ALLOW_CROSS_KEYSPACE_READS */ SELECT * FROM ks1.t1 JOIN ks2.t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
```

The VTGate flag prevents cross-keyspace reads globally, regardless of per-keyspace VSchema settings.

### <a id="minor-changes-vttablet"/>VTTablet</a>

#### <a id="vttablet-schema-max-table-count"/>Schema engine table-count limit is now configurable</a>

Previously the schema engine had a hardcoded cap of 10,000 tables: a vttablet whose underlying MySQL had more than 10,000 tables would fail to load its schema and could not serve queries. This made recovery from `EmergencyReparentShard` impossible without dropping tables directly on MySQL.

Two changes:

1. The schema engine no longer enforces a row cap on its reload queries. A vttablet with any number of tables will load successfully.
2. A new flag, `--queryserver-config-schema-max-table-count` (default `10000`), governs new schema object creation for tables and views. `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE VIEW` statements that would push the engine's tracked schema-object count above this limit are rejected at vttablet with a clear error before they reach MySQL. The flag is dynamic: changes are observed without restart.

Tablets that already have more tracked schema objects than the configured limit will reload fine — only new creations are gated. Operators who need to support more tables and views should increase the flag and ensure both vttablet and mysqld have enough memory to comfortably hold the larger schema.

See [#19978](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/19978) for details.

### <a id="minor-changes-vtctld"/>VTCtld</a>

#### <a id="vtctld-gettablets-stale-primary-alias"/>`GetTablets` stale primary reporting under `--tablet-alias` filter</a>

If your monitoring or automation parses `vtctldclient GetTablets --tablet-alias=...` output, stale former primaries now report as `unknown` instead of `primary`. Previously, when the real current primary was not included in the request, the server could mark a stale former primary as `primary`. Querying multiple stale aliases from different shards together was particularly affected: the result depended on which stale record had the later `primary_term_start_time`, and only the older one would be demoted.

The server now consults each shard's `Shard.PrimaryTermStartTime` via a parallel `GetShard` call (one per unique shard in the result) to determine the authoritative primary term, and reports demoted tablets with type `unknown`.

The `--keyspace/--shard` path produces the same output as before because the real primary is always present in that result set, so the seed already matched the shard record.

Transient cases where the shard record has no recorded primary yet (for example, the brief window after a promotion before the new term is written) fall back to the prior best-effort behavior, so tablets retain their on-disk type. If `GetShard` fails for a shard, the same fallback applies and a warning is logged; under `--strict`, the error is returned to the caller.

See [#19898](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/19898) for details.
