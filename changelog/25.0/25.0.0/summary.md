### <a id="new-support"/>New Support</a>

### <a id="breaking-changes"/>Breaking Changes</a>

#### <a id="vttablet-watch-replication-stream-removed"/>`--watch-replication-stream` flag removed</a>

The deprecated `--watch-replication-stream` VTTablet flag has been removed.

**Migration**: remove `--watch-replication-stream` from VTTablet startup arguments.

**Impact**: VTTablet will fail to start if `--watch-replication-stream` is still passed.

See [#20048](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/20048) for the removal and [#19204](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19204) for the original deprecation.

#### <a id="vtorc-snapshot-topology-removed"/>Snapshot Topology feature removed</a>

VTOrc's Snapshot Topology feature, [deprecated in v24](../../24.0/24.0.0/summary.md#vtorc-snapshot-topology-deprecation), has been removed. This includes the `--snapshot-topology-interval` flag and the `database_instance_topology_history` table.

**Migration**: remove `--snapshot-topology-interval` from VTOrc startup arguments.

**Impact**: VTOrc will fail to start if `--snapshot-topology-interval` is still passed.

See [#20048](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/20048) for the removal and [#19070](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19070) for the original deprecation.

#### <a id="vtorc-cell-required"/>VTOrc `--cell` flag is now required</a>

The `--cell` VTOrc flag, [introduced in v24](../../24.0/24.0.0/summary.md#vtorc-cell-flag), is now required.

**Migration**: ensure `--cell` is set on every VTOrc deployment.

**Impact**: VTOrc will fail to start with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error if `--cell` is empty.

See [#20048](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/20048) for the removal and [#19047](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19047) for the original `--cell` flag introduction.

### <a id="deprecations"/>Deprecations</a>

#### <a id="deprecated-cli-flags"/>CLI Flags</a>

The VTGate flag `--legacy-replication-lag-algorithm` is now deprecated and is a no-op. VTGate always uses the simpler replication lag algorithm based on low lag, high lag and the minimum number of tablets. A detailed explanation of the algorithm [is available in this code comment](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/discovery/replicationlag.go).

The flag will be removed entirely in v26. This deprecation is tracked in https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/18914.

**Impact**: Remove any usage of the `--legacy-replication-lag-algorithm` flag from VTGate startup scripts or configuration.

#### <a id="deprecated-selectstream-rule-plan"/>Legacy streaming-path plan types in query rules</a>

The `SelectStream` query plan type no longer exists: statements served over the streaming path now produce the same plan types as buffered execution (`Select`, `Show`, `SelectLockFunc`, ...), so query rules keyed on those concrete plan names now apply to both execution paths.

For backward compatibility, rules keep matching queries on the streaming path by their pre-v25 plan types:

- Rules files using `SelectStream` in a `Plans` condition keep loading and match only queries on the streaming path, for the statement shapes the streaming planner used to label `SelectStream` (`Select`, `SelectImpossible`, `SelectLockFunc`, `Nextval`, `Show`, `ShowMigrations`, `OtherRead`). VTTablet logs a deprecation warning when such a rule is loaded.
- `ANALYZE` statements on the streaming path, which used to carry the `OtherRead` plan type and now plan as `Select`, keep matching rules keyed on `OtherRead` (and do not match `SelectStream` rules, as before). Because `OtherRead` remains a valid plan name, this cannot be detected when the rules file is loaded; VTTablet logs a deprecation warning when a rule matches a streamed `ANALYZE` only through this compatibility behavior.

Both compatibility behaviors will be removed in v26, along with the `SelectStream` plan name.

**Impact**: Update query rules that use `SelectStream` to the concrete plan names listed above, and re-key `OtherRead` rules meant to gate streamed `ANALYZE` on the `Select` plan or a `Query` pattern. Note that rules keyed on concrete plan names match on both execution paths, not only streamed queries.

## <a id="minor-changes"/>Minor Changes</a>

#### <a id="vreplication-reverse-workflow-data-protection"/>Default data protection for `_reverse` workflow cancel/complete</a>

When calling `cancel` or `complete` on an auto-generated `_reverse` workflow without explicitly providing `--keep-data=false`, the system now defaults to keeping data and returns a warning. This prevents accidental deletion of production tables on the original source side, where the `_reverse` workflow's target is actually your production keyspace.

**Behavior change:**

| Workflow type | `--keep-data` flag | Effective `keep_data` | Warning emitted |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Normal       | omitted           | `false`              | No              |
| `_reverse`   | omitted           | `true`               | **Yes** |
| `_reverse`   | `--keep-data=false` | `false`            | No              |

The `--keep-data` flag help text has been updated to note this default explicitly. This change applies to MoveTables, Reshard, and other VReplication workflow types that use the shared cancel/complete paths.

See [#19906](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19906) for details.

### <a id="minor-changes-vtgate"/>VTGate</a>

#### <a id="vtgate-logstats-ingress-bytes"/>Ingress bytes in query LogStats</a>

VTGate query `LogStats` now include an `IngressBytes` field that records the approximate number of inbound request bytes attributed to each query.

For MySQL-protocol connections, this is the number of bytes read from the client packets for the command that produced the query, including any prepared-statement long-data chunks folded in when `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` consumes them. For gRPC connections, it is approximated from the serialized size of the protobuf request. When a single command carries multiple statements, the bytes are distributed across them by query length.

`IngressBytes` is available through the `LogStats` struct for telemetry and monitoring integrations. It is not written to VTGate's query log output and defaults to zero for callers that do not set it.

See [#20358](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/20358) for details.

#### <a id="vtgate-cross-keyspace-reads"/>New controls for cross-keyspace reads</a>

VTGate now supports preventing cross-keyspace reads (joins and UNIONs), preventing queries that would combine data from different keyspaces. This can be configured at two levels:

**VTGate flag** (applies to all queries):

```
--prevent-cross-keyspace-reads
```

**Per-keyspace VSchema setting** (applies to specific keyspaces):

```bash
vtctldclient ApplyVSchema --vschema='{"prevent_cross_keyspace_reads": true}' my_keyspace
```

When enabled, the planner will reject queries that require joining or combining (via UNION) tables from different keyspaces. This can be overridden on a per-query basis using the `ALLOW_CROSS_KEYSPACE_READS` comment directive:

```sql
/*vt+ ALLOW_CROSS_KEYSPACE_READS */ SELECT * FROM ks1.t1 JOIN ks2.t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
```

The VTGate flag prevents cross-keyspace reads globally, regardless of per-keyspace VSchema settings.

#### <a id="vtgate-streamexecute-real-errors"/>Streaming errors no longer surface as connection loss</a>

Streaming queries (under `SET workload = 'OLAP'`, multi-statement batches, and prepared-statement execution) previously returned `ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query` and tore down the underlying TCP connection whenever the streaming handler returned an error *after* the first row or field packet had been emitted. VTGate now writes a proper ERR packet in place of the result-set terminator, so the real error code and message reach the client and the connection remains usable for subsequent queries.

This affects all three streaming code paths in `go/mysql`: `COM_QUERY` (text protocol), multi-statement `COM_QUERY`, and `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` (binary protocol).

**Impact**: Application error-handling and retry logic that branched on `2013 / Lost connection` will now see the real error code — for example, `errno 1317 / context canceled` after a `KILL QUERY` against a streaming session, or planner errors such as `specifying two different database in the query is not supported`.

### <a id="minor-changes-vttablet"/>VTTablet</a>

#### <a id="vttablet-consolidator-reject-on-cap"/>Consolidator Reject on Waiter Cap</a>

A new `--consolidator-reject-on-cap` flag (default `false`) has been added to VTTablet. When enabled alongside a non-zero `--consolidator-query-waiter-cap`, queries that would join a consolidated result but exceed the **global** consolidator waiter cap are rejected with a `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error instead of silently falling back to independent MySQL execution.

**Important:** The cap is enforced against the consolidator's global `totalWaiterCount` across all queries, not a per-query waiter count. This means a duplicate for query B can be rejected because query A has already consumed most of the global waiter budget. This provides backpressure when the consolidator as a whole is saturated, rather than when any single query has too many waiters.

See [#19836](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19836) for details.

### <a id="minor-changes-vttablet"/>VTTablet</a>

#### <a id="vttablet-schema-max-table-count"/>Schema engine table-count limit is now configurable</a>

Previously the schema engine had a hardcoded cap of 10,000 tables: a vttablet whose underlying MySQL had more than 10,000 tables would fail to load its schema and could not serve queries. This made recovery from `EmergencyReparentShard` impossible without dropping tables directly on MySQL.

Two changes:

1. The schema engine no longer enforces a row cap on its reload queries. A vttablet with any number of tables will load successfully.
2. A new flag, `--queryserver-config-schema-max-table-count` (default `10000`), governs new schema object creation for tables and views. `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE VIEW` statements that would push the engine's tracked schema-object count above this limit are rejected at vttablet with a clear error before they reach MySQL. The flag is dynamic: changes are observed without restart.

Tablets that already have more tracked schema objects than the configured limit will reload fine — only new creations are gated. Operators who need to support more tables and views should increase the flag and ensure both vttablet and mysqld have enough memory to comfortably hold the larger schema.

See [#19978](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/19978) for details.

### <a id="minor-changes-general"/>General</a>

#### <a id="build-info-from-vcs"/>Build version metadata now sourced from VCS stamping</a>

The build timestamp is no longer injected via linker flags. Because it changed on every `make build`, it forced every binary to be re-linked even when nothing else changed. Build metadata is now read from the VCS information the Go toolchain stamps into the binary (`runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo`), which makes the linker flags stable across rebuilds and lets the build cache hit.

User-visible consequences:

- The `build_time` reported by `--version`, exposed via `/debug/vars` (`BuildTimestamp`), and set as a tablet tag (`build_time`) now defaults to the **commit time** of the built revision rather than the wall-clock time of the build.
- Binaries built from a dirty working tree report their Git revision with a `-dirty` suffix.

The `BUILD_GIT_REV`, `BUILD_GIT_BRANCH`, and `BUILD_TIME` environment-variable overrides still work for builds without VCS metadata (e.g. from a release tarball). When `BUILD_TIME` is set, it takes precedence over the commit time.
