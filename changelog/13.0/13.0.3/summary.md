## Major Changes

### Upgrade to `go1.17.13`

Vitess `v13.0.3` now runs on `go1.17.13`.
The patch release of Go, `go1.17.13`, was one of the main reasons for this release as it includes important security fixes to packages used by Vitess.
Below is a summary of this patch release. You can learn more [here](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.17).

> go1.17.13 (released 2022-08-01) includes security fixes to the encoding/gob and math/big packages, as well as bug fixes to the compiler and the runtime.
