## <a id="major-changes"/>Major Changes

### <a id="breaking-changes"/>Breaking Changes

### <a id="new-flag"/>New command line flags and behavior

#### <a id="new-flag-toggle-ers"/>VTOrc flag `--allow-emergency-reparent`

VTOrc has a new flag `--allow-emergency-reparent` that allows the users to toggle the ability of VTOrc to run emergency
reparent operations. The users that want VTOrc to fix the replication issues, but don't want it to run any reparents
should start using this flag. By default, VTOrc will be able to run `EmergencyReparentShard`. The users must specify the
flag to `false` to change the behaviour.

#### <a id="new-ers-subflag"/>ERS sub flag `--wait-for-all-tablets`

Running `EmergencyReparentShard` from the vtctldclient has a new sub-flag `--wait-for-all-tablets` that makes `EmergencyReparentShard` wait 
for a response from all the tablets. Originally `EmergencyReparentShard` was meant only to be run when a primary tablet is unreachable.
We have realized now that there are cases when the replication is broken but all the tablets are reachable. In these cases, it is advisable to 
call `EmergencyReparentShard` with `--wait-for-all-tablets` so that it doesn't ignore one of the tablets.

### <a id="vtadmin"/>VTAdmin

#### <a id="updated-node"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v18.16.0 (LTS)

Building vtadmin-web now requires node >= v18.16.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v16 to v18 are listed
in https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.0.0, but none apply to VTAdmin. Full details on v18.16.0 are listed
here https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.16.0.

### <a id="deprecations-and-deletions"/>Deprecations and Deletions

- `--buffer_implementation` is deprecated and will be removed in `v19.0`

VTGate flag:

- `--schema_change_signal_user` is deprecated and will be removed in `v19.0`

#### <a id="deleted-v3"/>Deleted `v3` planner

The `Gen4` planner has been the default planner since Vitess 14. The `v3` planner was deprecated in Vitess 15 and has now been removed in this release.

#### <a id="deleted-k8stopo"/>Deleted `k8stopo`

The `k8stopo` has been deprecated in Vitess 17, also see https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13298. With Vitess 18
the `k8stopo` has been removed.

#### <a id="deleted-vtgr"/>Deleted `vtgr`

The `vtgr` has been deprecated in Vitess 17, also see https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13300. With Vitess 18 `vtgr` has been removed.

### <a id="new-stats"/>New stats

#### <a id="vtgate-vindex-unknown-parameters"/>VTGate Vindex unknown parameters

The VTGate stat `VindexUnknownParameters` gauges unknown Vindex parameters found in the latest VSchema pulled from the topology.

### <a id="vttablet"/>VTTablet

#### <a id="vttablet-new-rpc-reset-sequences"/>New ResetSequences rpc

A new vttablet RPC `ResetSequences` has been added, which is being used by `MoveTables` and `Migrate` for workflows
where a `sequence` table is being moved (https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/13238). This has an impact on the
Vitess upgrade process from an earlier version if you need to use such a workflow before the entire cluster is upgraded.

Any MoveTables or Migrate workflow that moves a sequence table should only be run after all vitess components have been
upgraded, and no upgrade should be done while such a workflow is in progress.

#### <a id="vttablet-tx-throttler-dry-run"/>New Dry-run/monitoring-only mode for the transaction throttler

A new CLI flag `--tx-throttler-dry-run` to set the Transaction Throttler to monitoring-only/dry-run mode has been added.
If the transaction throttler is enabled with `--enable-tx-throttler` and the new dry-run flag is also specified, the
tablet will not actually throttle any transactions; however, it will increase the counters for transactions throttled
(`vttablet_transaction_throttler_throttled`). This allows users to deploy the transaction throttler in production and
gain observability on how much throttling would take place, without actually throttling any requests.

### <a id="docker"/>Docker

#### <a id="debian-bookworm"/>Bookworm added and made default

Bookworm was released on 2023-06-10, and will be the new default base container for Docker builds.
Bullseye images will still be built and available as long as the OS build is current, tagged with the `-bullseye` suffix.

#### <a id="debian-buster"/>Buster removed

Buster LTS supports will stop in June 2024, and Vitess v18.0 will be supported through October 2024. 
To prevent supporting a deprecated buster build for several months after June 2024, we are preemptively
removing Vitess support.
