# VtdbLogger's methods are called whenever something worth noting happens.
# The default behavior of the class is to log using the logging module.
# Registering a new implementation allows the client code to report the
# conditions to any custom reporting mechanism.
#
# We use this in the following cases:
# - error reporting (an exception happened)
# - performance logging (calls to other services took that long)
class VtdbLogger(object):

  # topology callbacks

  # topo_keyspace_fetch is called when we successfully get a SrvKeyspace object.

  # keyspaces from topo server.

  # when reading a keyspace. This is within an exception handler.
