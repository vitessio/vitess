// This configures a Service Worker with the given request handlers.
// Our test suites use Mock Service Workers (https://github.com/mswjs/msw)
// to mock HTTP responses from vtadmin-api.
//
// MSW lets us intercept requests at the network level. This decouples the tests from
// whatever particular HTTP fetcher interface we are using, and obviates the need
// to mock `fetch` directly (by using a library like jest-fetch-mock, for example).
//
// MSW gives us full control over the response, including edge cases like errors,
// malformed payloads, and timeouts.
//
// The big downside to mocking or "faking" APIs like vtadmin is that
// we end up re-implementing some (or all) of vtadmin-api in our test environment.
// It is, unfortunately, impossible to completely avoid this kind of duplication
// unless we solely use e2e tests (which have their own trade-offs).
//
// That said, our use of protobufjs to validate and strongly type HTTP responses
// means our fake is more robust than it would be otherwise. Since we are using
// the exact same protos in our fake as in our real vtadmin-api server, we're guaranteed
// to have type parity.
