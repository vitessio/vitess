# Vitess Control Panel

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.11-webpack.2.

## Pre-requisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed

## Installation
Once downloaded, run `npm install` to retrieve dependencies.

Webpack handles bundling of dependencies from the `node_modules` directory.

To add more Polymer elements, install them with bower and import them in `src/index.html`.

ng will be installed under node_modules/angular-cli/bin

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build. Copy them over to app/ for committing after testing
`cp -r -f dist/* app/`

You can also build from the top level using `make build_web`. You will need to have `ng` in your path for this to work.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
