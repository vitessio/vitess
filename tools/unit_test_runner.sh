# Custom Go unit test runner which runs all unit tests in parallel except for
# known flaky unit tests.
# Flaky unit tests are run sequentially in the second phase and retried up to
# three times.

# Why are there flaky unit tests?
#
# Some of the Go unit tests are inherently flaky e.g. because they use the
# real timer implementation and might fail when things take longer as usual.
# In particular, this happens when the system is under load and threads do not
# get scheduled as fast as usual. Then, the expected timings do not match.

# Set VT_GO_PARALLEL variable in the same way as the Makefile does.
# We repeat this here because this script is called directly by test.go
# and not via the Makefile.
