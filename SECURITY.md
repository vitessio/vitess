# Security Release Process

Vitess is a large growing community of volunteers, users, and vendors. The Vitess community has
adopted this security disclosure and response policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical
issues.

## Maintainers Team

Security vulnerabilities should be handled quickly and sometimes privately. The primary goal of this
process is to reduce the total time users are vulnerable to publicly known exploits.

The Vitess [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) team is responsible for the entire response including internal communication and external disclosure. In the future, we may delegate responsibility to a sub-team as other projects have elected to do so.

## Disclosures

### Private Disclosure Processes

The Vitess community asks that all suspected vulnerabilities be privately and responsibly disclosed via the [reporting policy](README.md#reporting-security-vulnerabilities).

### Public Disclosure Processes

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY email
[vitess-maintainers](mailto:cncf-vitess-maintainers@lists.cncf.io) so that we may start the patch, release, and communication process.

## Patch, Release, and Public Communication

For each reported vulnerability, a member of the maintainers team will volunteer to lead coordination of the fix (Fix Lead), and ensure that it is backported to each supported branch. They will then coordinate with the remainder of the maintainers team to coordinate new releases and ensure a communication plan is in place for vulnerability disclosure.

All of the timelines below are suggestions and assume a private disclosure. The Fix Lead drives the
schedule using their best judgment based on severity and development time. If the Fix Lead is
dealing with a public disclosure all timelines become ASAP (assuming the vulnerability has a CVSS
score >= 4; see below). If the fix relies on another upstream project's disclosure timeline, that
will adjust the process as well. We will work with the upstream project to fit their timeline and
best protect our users.

#### Policy for master-only vulnerabilities

If a security vulnerability affects master, but not a currently supported branch, then the following process will apply:

* The fix will land in master.
* A courtesy email will be sent to [vitess@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vitess) along with a posted notice in #developers on Slack.

#### Policy for unsupported releases

If a security vulnerability affects only a stable release which is no longer under active support, then the following process will apply:

* A fix **will not** be issued (exceptions may be made for extreme circumstances)
* An email will be sent to [vitess-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vitess-announce) identifying the threat, and encouraging users to upgrade.

#### Policy for supported releases 

If a security vulnerability affects supported branches, then a Fix Lead will be appointed and the full security process as defined below will apply.

### Fix Development Process

These steps should be completed within the 1-7 days of Disclosure.

- The Fix Lead will create a
  [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) using the [CVSS
  Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0). The Fix Lead makes the final call on the
  calculated CVSS; it is better to move quickly than making the CVSS perfect.
- The Fix Lead will notify the maintainers that work on the fix branch is complete. Maintainers will review the fix branch in a private repo and provide require LGTMs.

If the CVSS score is under 4.0 ([a low severity
score](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#i5)) the maintainers can decide to slow the
release process down in the face of holidays, developer bandwidth and other related circumstances.

### Fix Disclosure Process

With the fix development underway, the Fix Lead needs to come up with an overall communication plan
for the wider community. This Disclosure process should begin after the Fix Lead has developed a Fix
or mitigation so that a realistic timeline can be communicated to users.

**Disclosure of Forthcoming Fix to Users** (Completed within 1-7 days of Disclosure)

- The Fix Lead will email [vitess-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vitess-announce)
  informing users that a security vulnerability has been disclosed and that a fix will be made
  available at YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC in the future via this list. This time is the Release Date.
- The Fix Lead will include any mitigating steps users can take until a fix is available.

The communication to users should be actionable. They should know when to block time to apply
patches, understand exact mitigation steps, etc.

**Disclosure of Fixed Vulnerability**

- The Fix Lead will email [vitess-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vitess-announce)
  informing users that there are new releases available to address an identified vulnerability.
- As much as possible this email should be actionable and include links to CVEs, and how to apply
  the fix to user's environments; this can include links to external distributor documentation.

### Embargo Policy

The Vitess team currently does not provide advance notice of undisclosed vulnerabilities to any third parties. We are open to feedback on what such a policy can or should look like.  For the interim, the best way to receive advanced notice of undisclosed vulnerabilities is to apply to join the maintainers team.
