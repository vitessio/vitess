  # Similar to how discovery flags are forwarded to the particular discovery
  # implementation, the vtctld and vtgate proxy components for a cluster are
  # configurable, by the prefixes "vtctld-" (for vtctld proxy) and "vtsql-" (for vtgate proxy).
  # These flags are defined in code in the (*Config).Parse functions in packages

  # VTAdmin also provides different RPC pools to gate the number of concurrent
  # requests it will make against vtctlds/vtgates in a given cluster, to prevent
  # overwhelming those components.

  # The backup read pool is used to constrain the number of GetBackups calls
  # made to a cluster simultaneously.

  # - topo-read-pool => for generic topo methods (e.g. GetKeyspace, FindAllShardsInKeyspace)
  # - workflow-read-pool => for GetWorkflow/GetWorkflows api methods.
