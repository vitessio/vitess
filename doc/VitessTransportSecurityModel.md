# Vitess Transport Security Model

Vitess exposes a few RPC services, and internally also uses RPCs.  These RPCs
may use secure transport options. This document explains how to use these
features.

## Overview

The following diagram represents all the RPCs we use in a Vitess cluster:

There are two main categories:

* Internal RPCs: they are used to connect Vitess components.
* Externally visible RPCs: they are use by the app to talk to Vitess.

A few features in the Vitess ecosystem depend on authentication, like Called ID
and table ACLs. We'll explore the Caller ID feature first.

The encryption and authentication scheme used depends on the transport
used. With gRPC (the default for Vitess), TLS can be used to secure both
internal and external RPCs. We'll detail what the options are.

## Caller ID

Caller ID is a feature provided by the Vitess stack to identify the source of
queries. There are two different Caller IDs:

* **Immediate Caller ID**: It represents the secure client identity when it
  enters the Vitess side:
  * It is a single string, represents the user connecting to Vitess (vtgate).
  * It is authenticated by the transport layer used.
  * It is used by the Vitess TableACL feature.
* **Effective Caller ID**: It provides detailed information on who the
  individual caller process is:
  * It contains more information about the caller: principal, component,
    sub-component.
  * It is provided by the application layer.
  * It is not authenticated.
  * It is exposed in query logs to be able to debug the source of a slow query,
    for instance.

## gRPC Transport

When using gRPC transport, Vitess can use the usual TLS security features
(familiarity with SSL / TLS is necessary here):

* Any Vitess server can be configured to use TLS with the following
  command line parameters:
  * grpc\_cert, grpc\_key: server cert and key to use.
  * grpc\_ca (optional): client cert chains to trust. If specified, the client
    must use a certificate signed by one ca in the provided file.
* A Vitess go client can be configured with symetrical parameters to enable TLS:
  * ...\_grpc\_ca: list of server cert signers to trust.
  * ...\_grpc\_server\_name: name of the server cert to trust, instead of the
    hostname used to connect.
  * ...\_grpc\_cert, ...\_grpc\_key: client side cert and key to use (when the
    server requires client authentication)
* Other clients can take similar parameters, in various ways, see each client
  for more information.

With these options, it is possible to use TLS-secured connections for all parts
of the system. This enables the server side to authenticate the client, and / or
the client to authenticate the server.

Note this is not enabled by default, as usually the different Vitess servers
will run on a private network (in a Cloud environment, usually all local traffic
is already secured over a VPN, for instance).

Additionally, if a client uses a certificate to connect to Vitess (vtgate), the
common name of that certificate is passed to vttablet as the Immediate Caller
ID. It can then be used by table ACLs, to grant read, write or admin access to
individual tables. This should be used if different clients should have
different access to Vitess tables.
