By default, the [Kubernetes configs](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/examples/kubernetes)
point to the `vitess/lite` image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vitess/).

We created the `lite` image as a stripped down version of our main image `base` such that Kubernetes pods can start faster.
The `lite` image does not change very often and is updated manually by the Vitess team with every release.
In contrast, the `base` image is updated automatically after every push to the GitHub master branch.
For more information on the different images we provide, please read the [`docker/README.md` file](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/docker).

If your goal is run the latest Vitess code, the simplest solution is to use the bigger `base` image instead of `lite`.

Another alternative is to customize our Docker images and build them yourselves.
This is described below and involves building the `base` image first.
Then you can run our build script for the `lite` image which extracts the Vitess binaries from the built `base` image.

1.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your workstation.

    Our scripts also assume you can run the `docker` command without `sudo`,
    which you can do by [setting up a docker group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group).

1.  Create an account on [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) and
    then `docker login` to it.

1.  Go to your `src/vitess.io/vitess` directory.

1.  Usually, you won't need to [build your own bootstrap image]
    (https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/docker/bootstrap/README.md)
    unless you edit [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)
    or [vendor.json](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/vendor/vendor.json),
    for example to add new dependencies. If you do need it then build the
    bootstrap image, otherwise pull the image using one of the following
    commands depending on the MySQL flavor you want:

    ```sh
    vitess$ docker pull vitess/bootstrap:mysql57   # MySQL Community Edition 5.7
    vitess$ docker pull vitess/bootstrap:mysql56   # MySQL Community Edition 5.6
    vitess$ docker pull vitess/bootstrap:percona57 # Percona Server 5.7
    vitess$ docker pull vitess/bootstrap:percona   # Percona Server
    vitess$ docker pull vitess/bootstrap:mariadb   # MariaDB
    ```

    **Note:** If you have already downloaded the `vitess/bootstrap:<flavor>`
    image on your machine before then it could be old, which may cause build
    failures. So it would be a good idea to always execute this step.

1.  Build the `vitess/base[:<flavor>]` image.
    It will include the compiled the Vitess binaries.
    (`vitess/base` also contains the source code and tests i.e. everything needed for development work.)

    Choose one of the following commands (the command without suffix builds
    the default image containing MySQL 5.7):

    ```sh
    vitess$ make docker_base
    vitess$ make docker_base_mysql56
    vitess$ make docker_base_percona57
    vitess$ make docker_base_percona
    vitess$ make docker_base_mariadb
    ```

1.  Build the `vitess/lite[:<flavor>]` image.
    This will run a script that extracts from `vitess/base` only the files
    needed to run Vitess.

    Choose one of the following commands (the command without suffix builds
    the default image containing MySQL 5.7):

    ```sh
    vitess$ make docker_lite
    vitess$ make docker_lite_mysql56
    vitess$ make docker_lite_percona57
    vitess$ make docker_lite_percona
    vitess$ make docker_lite_mariadb
    ```

1.  Re-tag the image under your personal repository, then upload it.

    ```sh
    vitess$ docker tag -f vitess/lite yourname/vitess
    vitess$ docker push yourname/vitess
    ```

    **Note:** If you chose a non-default flavor above, then change `vitess/lite` in
    the above command to `vitess/lite:<flavor>`.

1.  Change the Kubernetes configs to point to your personal repository:

    ```sh
    vitess/examples/kubernetes$ sed -i -e 's,image: vitess/lite,image: yourname/vitess:latest,' *.yaml
    ```

    Adding the `:latest` label at the end of the image name tells Kubernetes
    to check for a newer image every time a pod is launched.
    When you push a new version of your image, any new pods will use it
    automatically without you having to clear the Kubernetes image cache.

    Once you've stabilized your image, you'll probably want to replace `:latest`
    with a specific label that you change each time you make a new build,
    so you can control when pods update.

1.  Launch [Vitess on Kubernetes]({% link getting-started/index.md %}) as usual.
