### ExecuteBatchKeyspaceIds

ExecuteBatchKeyspaceIds executes the list of queries based on the specified keyspace ids.

#### Request

 ExecuteBatchKeyspaceIdsRequest is the payload to ExecuteBatchKeyspaceId.

##### Parameters

| Name |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>caller_id</code> <br>[vtrpc.CallerID](#vtrpc.callerid)| CallerID is passed along RPCs to identify the originating client for a request. It is not meant to be secure, but only informational.  The client can put whatever info they want in these fields, and they will be trusted by the servers. The fields will just be used for logging purposes, and to easily find a client. VtGate propagates it to VtTablet, and VtTablet may use this information for monitoring purposes, to display on dashboards, or for blacklisting purposes. |
| <code>session</code> <br>[Session](#session)| Session objects are session cookies and are invalidated on use. Query results will contain updated session values. Their content should be opaque to the user. |
| <code>queries</code> <br>list &lt;[BoundKeyspaceIdQuery](#boundkeyspaceidquery)&gt;| BoundKeyspaceIdQuery represents a single query request for the specified list of keyspace ids. This is used in a list for ExecuteBatchKeyspaceIdsRequest. |
| <code>tablet_type</code> <br>[topodata.TabletType](#topodata.tablettype)| TabletType represents the type of a given tablet. |
| <code>as_transaction</code> <br>bool| as_transaction will execute the queries in this batch in a single transaction per shard, created for this purpose. (this can be seen as adding a 'begin' before and 'commit' after the queries). Only makes sense if tablet_type is master. If set, the Session is ignored. |
| <code>options</code> <br>[query.ExecuteOptions](#query.executeoptions)| ExecuteOptions is passed around for all Execute calls. |

#### Response

 ExecuteBatchKeyspaceIdsResponse is the returned value from ExecuteBatchKeyspaceId.

| Name |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>error</code> <br>[vtrpc.RPCError](#vtrpc.rpcerror)| RPCError is an application-level error structure returned by VtTablet (and passed along by VtGate if appropriate). We use this so the clients don't have to parse the error messages, but instead can depend on the value of the code. |
| <code>session</code> <br>[Session](#session)| Session objects are session cookies and are invalidated on use. Query results will contain updated session values. Their content should be opaque to the user. |
| <code>results</code> <br>list &lt;[query.QueryResult](#query.queryresult)&gt;| QueryResult is returned by Execute and ExecuteStream.  As returned by Execute, len(fields) is always equal to len(row) (for each row in rows).

##Map Reduce
### SplitQuery

Split a query into non-overlapping sub queries

#### Request

 SplitQueryRequest is the payload to SplitQuery.  SplitQuery takes a "SELECT" query and generates a list of queries called "query-parts". Each query-part consists of the original query with an added WHERE clause that restricts the query-part to operate only on rows whose values in the the columns listed in the "split_column" field of the request (see below) are in a particular range.  It is guaranteed that the set of rows obtained from executing each query-part on a database snapshot and merging (without deduping) the results is equal to the set of rows obtained from executing the original query on the same snapshot with the rows containing NULL values in any of the split_column's excluded.  This is typically called by the MapReduce master when reading from Vitess. There it's desirable that the sets of rows returned by the query-parts have roughly the same size.

##### Parameters

| Name |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>caller_id</code> <br>[vtrpc.CallerID](#vtrpc.callerid)| CallerID is passed along RPCs to identify the originating client for a request. It is not meant to be secure, but only informational.  The client can put whatever info they want in these fields, and they will be trusted by the servers. The fields will just be used for logging purposes, and to easily find a client. VtGate propagates it to VtTablet, and VtTablet may use this information for monitoring purposes, to display on dashboards, or for blacklisting purposes. |
| <code>keyspace</code> <br>string| keyspace to target the query to. |
| <code>query</code> <br>[query.BoundQuery](#query.boundquery)| BoundQuery is a query with its bind variables |
| <code>split_column</code> <br>list &lt;string&gt;| Each generated query-part will be restricted to rows whose values in the columns listed in this field are in a particular range. The list of columns named here must be a prefix of the list of columns defining some index or primary key of the table referenced in 'query'. For many tables using the primary key columns (in order) is sufficient and this is the default if this field is omitted. See the comment on the 'algorithm' field for more restrictions and information. |
| <code>split_count</code> <br>int64| You can specify either an estimate of the number of query-parts to generate or an estimate of the number of rows each query-part should return. Thus, exactly one of split_count or num_rows_per_query_part should be nonzero. The non-given parameter is calculated from the given parameter using the formula: split_count * num_rows_per_query_pary = table_size, where table_size is an approximation of the number of rows in the table. Note that if "split_count" is given it is regarded as an estimate. The number of query-parts returned may differ slightly (in particular, if it's not a whole multiple of the number of vitess shards). |
| <code>num_rows_per_query_part</code> <br>int64| |
| <code>algorithm</code> <br>query.SplitQueryRequest.Algorithm| The algorithm to use to split the query. The split algorithm is performed on each database shard in parallel. The lists of query-parts generated by the shards are merged and returned to the caller. Two algorithms are supported: EQUAL_SPLITS If this algorithm is selected then only the first 'split_column' given is used (or the first primary key column if the 'split_column' field is empty). In the rest of this algorithm's description, we refer to this column as "the split column". The split column must have numeric type (integral or floating point). The algorithm works by taking the interval [min, max], where min and max are the minimum and maximum values of the split column in the table-shard, respectively, and partitioning it into 'split_count' sub-intervals of equal size. The added WHERE clause of each query-part restricts that part to rows whose value in the split column belongs to a particular sub-interval. This is fast, but requires that the distribution of values of the split column be uniform in [min, max] for the number of rows returned by each query part to be roughly the same. FULL_SCAN If this algorithm is used then the split_column must be the primary key columns (in order). This algorithm performs a full-scan of the table-shard referenced in 'query' to get "boundary" rows that are num_rows_per_query_part apart when the table is ordered by the columns listed in 'split_column'. It then restricts each query-part to the rows located between two successive boundary rows. This algorithm supports multiple split_column's of any type, but is slower than EQUAL_SPLITS. |
| <code>use_split_query_v2</code> <br>bool| Whether to use the new split-query code that supports multiple split-columns and the FULL_SCAN algorithm. This is a temporary field which aids in the migration of SplitQuery to the new code. to the SplitQuery version 2. |

### GetSrvKeyspace

GetSrvKeyspace returns a SrvKeyspace object (as seen by this vtgate). This method is provided as a convenient way for clients to take a look at the sharding configuration for a Keyspace. Looking at the sharding information should not be used for routing queries (as the information may change, use the Execute calls for that). It is convenient for monitoring applications for instance, or if using custom sharding.

| <code>BYTES</code> | <code>2</code> | BYTES is when an array of bytes is used. This is represented as 'varbinary' in mysql  |

### topodata.TabletType

 TabletType represents the type of a given tablet.

| Name |Value |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>UNKNOWN</code> | <code>0</code> | UNKNOWN is not a valid value.  |
| <code>MASTER</code> | <code>1</code> | MASTER is the master server for the shard. Only MASTER allows DMLs.  |
| <code>REPLICA</code> | <code>2</code> | REPLICA is a slave type. It is used to serve live traffic. A REPLICA can be promoted to MASTER. A demoted MASTER will go to REPLICA.  |
| <code>RDONLY</code> | <code>3</code> | RDONLY (old name) / BATCH (new name) is used to serve traffic for long-running jobs. It is a separate type from REPLICA so long-running queries don't affect web-like traffic.  |
| <code>BATCH</code> | <code>3</code> |  |
| <code>SPARE</code> | <code>4</code> | SPARE is a type of servers that cannot serve queries, but is available in case an extra server is needed.  |
| <code>EXPERIMENTAL</code> | <code>5</code> | EXPERIMENTAL is like SPARE, except it can serve queries. This type can be used for usages not planned by Vitess, like online export to another storage engine.  |
| <code>BACKUP</code> | <code>6</code> | BACKUP is the type a server goes to when taking a backup. No queries can be served in BACKUP mode.  |
| <code>RESTORE</code> | <code>7</code> | RESTORE is the type a server uses when restoring a backup, at startup time.  No queries can be served in RESTORE mode.  |
| <code>DRAINED</code> | <code>8</code> | DRAINED is the type a server goes into when a process needs a separate tablet set aside for a specific action. For example, a vtworker process may set a tablet to drained to perform an offline action. It is a serving type (as the vtworker processes may need queries to run). In this state, this tablet is dedicated to the background process that uses it.  |

### vtrpc.ErrorCode

 ErrorCode is the enum values for Errors. Internally, errors should be created with one of these codes. These will then be translated over the wire by various RPC frameworks.

| Name |Value |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>SUCCESS</code> | <code>0</code> | SUCCESS is returned from a successful call.  |
| <code>CANCELLED</code> | <code>1</code> | CANCELLED means that the context was cancelled (and noticed in the app layer, as opposed to the RPC layer).  |
| <code>UNKNOWN_ERROR</code> | <code>2</code> | UNKNOWN_ERROR includes: 1. MySQL error codes that we don't explicitly handle. 2. MySQL response that wasn't as expected. For example, we might expect a MySQL timestamp to be returned in a particular way, but it wasn't. 3. Anything else that doesn't fall into a different bucket.  |
| <code>BAD_INPUT</code> | <code>3</code> | BAD_INPUT is returned when an end-user either sends SQL that couldn't be parsed correctly, or tries a query that isn't supported by Vitess.  |
| <code>DEADLINE_EXCEEDED</code> | <code>4</code> | DEADLINE_EXCEEDED is returned when an action is taking longer than a given timeout.  |
| <code>INTEGRITY_ERROR</code> | <code>5</code> | INTEGRITY_ERROR is returned on integrity error from MySQL, usually due to duplicate primary keys.  |
| <code>PERMISSION_DENIED</code> | <code>6</code> | PERMISSION_DENIED errors are returned when a user requests access to something that they don't have permissions for.  |
| <code>RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED</code> | <code>7</code> | RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED is returned when a query exceeds its quota in some dimension and can't be completed due to that. Queries that return RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED should not be retried, as it could be detrimental to the server's health. Examples of errors that will cause the RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED code: 1. TxPoolFull: this is retried server-side, and is only returned as an error if the server-side retries failed. 2. Query is killed due to it taking too long.  |
| <code>QUERY_NOT_SERVED</code> | <code>8</code> | QUERY_NOT_SERVED means that a query could not be served right now. Client can interpret it as: "the tablet that you sent this query to cannot serve the query right now, try a different tablet or try again later." This could be due to various reasons: QueryService is not serving, should not be serving, wrong shard, wrong tablet type, blacklisted table, etc. Clients that receive this error should usually retry the query, but after taking the appropriate steps to make sure that the query will get sent to the correct tablet.  |
| <code>NOT_IN_TX</code> | <code>9</code> | NOT_IN_TX means that we're not currently in a transaction, but we should be.  |
| <code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> | <code>10</code> | INTERNAL_ERRORs are problems that only the server can fix, not the client. These errors are not due to a query itself, but rather due to the state of the system. Generally, we don't expect the errors to go away by themselves, but they may go away after human intervention. Examples of scenarios where INTERNAL_ERROR is returned: 1. Something is not configured correctly internally. 2. A necessary resource is not available, and we don't expect it to become available by itself. 3. A sanity check fails. 4. Some other internal error occurs. Clients should not retry immediately, as there is little chance of success. However, it's acceptable for retries to happen internally, for example to multiple backends, in case only a subset of backend are not functional.  |
| <code>TRANSIENT_ERROR</code> | <code>11</code> | TRANSIENT_ERROR is used for when there is some error that we expect we can recover from automatically - often due to a resource limit temporarily being reached. Retrying this error, with an exponential backoff, should succeed. Clients should be able to successfully retry the query on the same backends. Examples of things that can trigger this error: 1. Query has been throttled 2. VtGate could have request backlog  |
| <code>UNAUTHENTICATED</code> | <code>12</code> | UNAUTHENTICATED errors are returned when a user requests access to something, and we're unable to verify the user's authentication.  |

### vtrpc.CallerID

CallerID is passed along RPCs to identify the originating client for a request. It is not meant to be secure, but only informational.  The client can put whatever info they want in these fields, and they will be trusted by the servers. The fields will just be used for logging purposes, and to easily find a client. VtGate propagates it to VtTablet, and VtTablet may use this information for monitoring purposes, to display on dashboards, or for blacklisting purposes.

#### Properties

| Name |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>principal</code> <br>string| principal is the effective user identifier. It is usually filled in with whoever made the request to the appserver, if the request came from an automated job or another system component. If the request comes directly from the Internet, or if the Vitess client takes action on its own accord, it is okay for this field to be absent. |
| <code>component</code> <br>string| component describes the running process of the effective caller. It can for instance be the hostname:port of the servlet initiating the database call, or the container engine ID used by the servlet. |
| <code>subcomponent</code> <br>string| subcomponent describes a component inisde the immediate caller which is responsible for generating is request. Suggested values are a servlet name or an API endpoint name. |

### vtrpc.RPCError

RPCError is an application-level error structure returned by VtTablet (and passed along by VtGate if appropriate). We use this so the clients don't have to parse the error messages, but instead can depend on the value of the code.

#### Properties

| Name |Description |
| :-------- | :-------- 
| <code>code</code> <br>[ErrorCode](#vtrpc.errorcode)| |
| <code>message</code> <br>string| |
