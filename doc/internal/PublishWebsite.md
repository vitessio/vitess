# Publishing vitess.io Web Site

## Overview

Our website [vitess.io](http://vitess.io) are static HTML pages which are
generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) from Markdown files
located in the [`doc/`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/doc)
directory.

The generated files will be put in the
[`docs/`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/docs) directory (note
the extra **s**). GitHub serves the website from this directory off the master
branch.

## TL;DR

### To preview site locally

*   Run:

    ```
    ./vitess.io/publish-site.sh
    ```

*   Site should be live at localhost:4000

### To publish the site

*   Make sure your doc and site changes have been committed to your branch and
    your branch is clean.
*   Run:

    ```
    ./vitess.io/publish-site.sh
    ```

*   Sanity check the diffs.
    *   `git diff HEAD~`
*   Create a pull request for your branch and let somebody review it.
*   Merge the pull request into the master branch.

## Details

### Directory Structure

We have three main directories:

*   [`doc/`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/doc) - original
    content
*   [`docs/`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/docs) - generated
    website actually served at http://vitess.io/
*   [`vitess.io/`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/vitess.io) -
    all relevant files for the website e.g.
    *   Jekyll configuration
    *   images e.g. our logo
    *   CSS
    *   [Navigation
        menu](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/vitess.io/_includes/left-nav-menu.html)
    *   boiler plate markdown files which include the actual content from the
        `doc/` directory
        ([example](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/vitess.io/contributing/github-workflow.md))

The boiler plate markdown files have multiple purposes:

*   feed the actual content into a template which adds e.g. the navigation to
    the file
*   re-arrange paths on the website e.g.
    [`doc/GitHubWorkFlow.md`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/doc/GitHubWorkflow.md)
    is actually served as http://vitess.io/contributing/github-workflow/
    because there is the file
    [`vitess.io/contributing/github-workflow.md`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/vitess.io/contributing/github-workflow.md).

### Changing Content

To modify our website, you need to:

*   change the underlying Markdown files in the `doc/` directory
*   re-generate the static pages (see [`publish-site.sh`
    above](#to-publish-the-site))
*   merge your changes into the master branch e.g. as pull request

### Linking pages

Always use the `{% raw %}{% link ... %}{% endraw %}` template tag to link other pages.

Note that you have to refer to the `.md` file of the page. Example:

```
[GitHub Workflow page]({% raw %}{% link contributing/github-workflow.md %}{% endraw %})
```

### Adding new Pages

If you want to add a new page, you must also:

*   add it to the left menu:
    [`vitess.io/_includes/left-nav-menu.html`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/vitess.io/_includes/left-nav-menu.html)
*   create a boiler plate .md file. Example:
    [`vitess.io/contributing/github-workflow.md`](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/vitess.io/contributing/github-workflow.md)

When you add a new section to the menu, please create a new directory below
`vitess.io/`. For example, the "Contributing" section is served out of
`vitess.io/contributing/`.

The main file in the section should have `index.md` as its boiler plate counter
part. Example: `doc/Contributing.md` is included by
`vitess.io/contributing/index.md` and therefore served as
http://vitess.io/contributing/.

Make sure that you use `{% raw %}{% link ... %}{% endraw %}` to generate the URLs.
See existing entries for examples.

### Orphaned doc/ Markdown Files

There are several files in `doc/` which are currently not visible on
http://vitess.io.

Examples:

*   https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/doc/LifeOfAQuery.md
*   https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/doc/V3VindexDesign.md

This is fine and accepted. Users can still view them on GitHub.com.

Note that these files should include images using the full path e.g. in
`LifeOfAQuery.md`:

```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vitessio/vitess/master/doc/life_of_a_query.png)
```

Otherwise GitHub cannot find and show the images.

## Jekyll Install Instructions

This section describes how to install Jekyll to generate the website.

### The Easy Way

*   Install Docker.
*   Run the `./vitess.io/preview-site.sh` and `./vitess.io/publish-site.sh` commands as shown above.

### The Hard Way

*   On Ubuntu, you need a non-root Ruby install so gem packages can be
    installed correctly.
    *   [Install rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation).
    *   Close and re-open your shell to complete the installation.
    *   [Install
        ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build#installation)
        plugin for rbenv.
    *   Use rbenv to build a recent version of Ruby.
    *   rbenv install 2.2.3
    *   You may need to install extra dependencies. The build output should tell
        you which packages. For example: ```sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev```
    *   Set the new Ruby as the system-wide default.
        *   ```rbenv global 2.2.3```
        *   ```rbenv rehash```
*   Install bundler.
    *   ```gem install bundler```
*   Install "nodejs" as JavaScript runtime.
    *   ```sudo apt-get install nodejs```
    *   In Ubuntu, the binary is unfortunately renamed from "node" to "nodejs".
        We work-around this by creating a "node" symlink on a directory which is
        early in the PATH list: ```ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs $HOME/.rbenv/bin/node```
*   Add `--docker=false` to the commands above.
