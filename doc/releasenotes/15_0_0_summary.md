## Major Changes

### Command-line syntax deprecations

#### vttablet startup flag deletions
The following VTTablet flags were deprecated in 7.0. They have now been deleted
- --queryserver-config-message-conn-pool-size
- --queryserver-config-message-conn-pool-prefill-parallelism
- --client-found-rows-pool-size --queryserver-config-transaction-cap will be used instead
- --transaction_shutdown_grace_period Use --shutdown_grace_period instead
- --queryserver-config-max-dml-rows
- --queryserver-config-allowunsafe-dmls
- --pool-name-prefix
- --enable-autocommit Autocommit is always allowed

#### vttablet startup flag deprecations
- --enable-query-plan-field-caching is now deprecated. It will be removed in v16.

### New Syntax

### VDiff2

We introduced the ability to resume a VDiff2 workflow:
```
$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 customer.commerce2customer resume 4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0
VDiff 4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0 resumed on target shards, use show to view progress

$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 customer.commerce2customer show last

VDiff Summary for customer.commerce2customer (4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0)
State:        completed
RowsCompared: 196
HasMismatch:  false
StartedAt:    2022-06-26 22:44:29
CompletedAt:  2022-06-26 22:44:31

Use "--format=json" for more detailed output.

$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 --format=json customer.commerce2customer show last
{
	"Workflow": "commerce2customer",
	"Keyspace": "customer",
	"State": "completed",
	"UUID": "4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0",
	"RowsCompared": 196,
	"HasMismatch": false,
	"Shards": "0",
	"StartedAt": "2022-06-26 22:44:29",
	"CompletedAt": "2022-06-26 22:44:31"
}
```

### New command line flags and behavior

#### Support for additional compressor and decompressor during backup & restore
We have introduced feature to use your own compressor & decompressor during backup & restore, instead of relying on default compressor. 
There are some built-in compressors which you can use out-of-box instead of default 'pgzip'. We left it to client to evaluate which option
works better for their use-cases. Here are the flags for this feature

- --builtin_compressor
- --builtin_decompressor
- --external_compressor
- --external_decompressor
- --external_compressor_extension
- --compression_level

builtin_compressor as of today support the following compression out-of-box
- pgzip
- pargzip
- lz4
- zstd

If you want to use any of the builtin compressor, simply set one of the above value for "--builtin_compressor". You don't need to set
the builtin_decompressor flag in this case as we infer it automatically from the MANIFEST file. The default value for --builtin_decompressor
is set to "auto".

If you are using custom command or external tool for compression then you need to use "--external_compressor/--external_decompressor" flag.
You need to provide complete command with arguments to these flags. "external_compressor_extension" needs to be set if you are using external
compressor. Leave the value of --builtin_compressor & --builtin-decompressor to their default values if you are using external compressor.
Please note that if you want the current behavior then you don't need to change anything in these flags. You can read more about backup & restore
[here] (https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/)

### Online DDL changes

#### Concurrent vitess migrations

All Online DDL migrations using the `vitess` strategy are now eligible to run concurrently, given `--allow-concurrent` DDL strategy flag. Until now, only `CREATE`, `DROP` and `REVERT` migrations were eligible, and now `ALTER` migrations are supported, as well. The terms for `ALTER` migrations concurrency:

- DDL strategy must be `vitess --allow-concurent ...`
- No two migrations can run concurrently on same table
- No two `ALTER`s will copy table data concurrently
- A concurrent `ALTER` migration will not start if another `ALTER` is running and is not `ready_to_complete`

The main use case is to run multiple concurrent migrations, all with `--postpone-completion`. All table-copy operations will run sequentially, but no migration will actually cut-over, and eventually all migration will be `ready_to_complete`, continuously tailing the binary logs and keeping up-to-date. A quick and iterative `ALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '...' COMPLETE` sequence of commands will cut-over all migrations _closely together_ (though not atomically together).

### Tablet throttler

#### API changes

API endpoint `/debug/vars` now exposes throttler metrics, such as number of hits and errors per app per check type. Example:

```shell
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:15100/debug/vars | jq . | grep Throttler
  "ThrottlerAggregatedMysqlSelf": 0.191718,
  "ThrottlerAggregatedMysqlShard": 0.960054,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyError": 27,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlSelfError": 13,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlSelfTotal": 38,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlShardError": 14,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlShardTotal": 42,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyTotal": 80,
  "ThrottlerCheckMysqlSelfSecondsSinceHealthy": 0,
  "ThrottlerCheckMysqlShardSecondsSinceHealthy": 0,
  "ThrottlerProbesLatency": 355523,
  "ThrottlerProbesTotal": 74,
```
