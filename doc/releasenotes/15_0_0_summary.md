## Major Changes

### Command-line syntax deprecations

#### vttablet startup flag --enable-query-plan-field-caching
This flag is now deprecated. It will be removed in v16.

### New Syntax

### VDiff2

We introduced the ability to resume a VDiff2 workflow:
```
$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 customer.commerce2customer resume 4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0
VDiff 4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0 resumed on target shards, use show to view progress

$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 customer.commerce2customer show last

VDiff Summary for customer.commerce2customer (4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0)
State:        completed
RowsCompared: 196
HasMismatch:  false
StartedAt:    2022-06-26 22:44:29
CompletedAt:  2022-06-26 22:44:31

Use "--format=json" for more detailed output.

$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 --format=json customer.commerce2customer show last
{
	"Workflow": "commerce2customer",
	"Keyspace": "customer",
	"State": "completed",
	"UUID": "4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0",
	"RowsCompared": 196,
	"HasMismatch": false,
	"Shards": "0",
	"StartedAt": "2022-06-26 22:44:29",

}
```

### New command line flags and behavior

### Online DDL changes

#### Concurrent vitess migrations

All Online DDL migrations using the `vitess` strategy are now eligible to run concurrently, given `--allow-concurrent` DDL strategy flag. Until now, only `CREATE`, `DROP` and `REVERT` migrations were eligible, and now `ALTER` migrations are supported, as well. The terms for `ALTER` migrations concurrency:

- DDL strategy must be `vitess --allow-concurent ...`
- No two migrations can run concurrently on same table
- No two `ALTER`s will copy table data concurrently
- A concurrent `ALTER` migration will not start if another `ALTER` is running and is not `ready_to_complete`

The main use case is to run multiple concurrent migrations, all with `--postpone-completion`. All table-copy operations will run sequentially, but no migration will actually cut-over, and eventually all migration will be `ready_to_complete`, continuously tailing the binary logs and keeping up-to-date. A quick and iterative `ALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '...' COMPLETE` sequence of commands will cut-over all migrations _closely together_ (though not atomically together).

### Tablet throttler

#### API changes

API endpoint `/debug/vars` now exposes throttler metrics, such as number of hits and errors per app per check type. Example:

```shell
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:15100/debug/vars | jq . | grep Throttler
  "ThrottlerAggregatedMysqlSelf": 0.191718,
  "ThrottlerAggregatedMysqlShard": 0.960054,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyError": 27,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlSelfError": 13,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlSelfTotal": 38,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlShardError": 14,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlShardTotal": 42,
  "ThrottlerCheckAnyTotal": 80,
  "ThrottlerCheckMysqlSelfSecondsSinceHealthy": 0,
  "ThrottlerCheckMysqlShardSecondsSinceHealthy": 0,
  "ThrottlerProbesLatency": 355523,
  "ThrottlerProbesTotal": 74,
```
