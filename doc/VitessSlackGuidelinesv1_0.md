# Vitess Slack Guidelines v1.0

The [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) applies in all areas in addition to these rules:

## Channel Spamming
Slack is our best communication medium for the community. Please keep your messages on topic for each channel, and please use the appropriate channel. Spamming channels with unrelated or marketing messages is not allowed.

## Unwanted Solicitation through Private Messages
Directly messaging users (unless the user has specifically requested the information) offering services, events, employment opportunities or freelance projects, is not allowed.

### Unwanted Voice/Video Calling
Abuse of the voice/video calling features to call users without their permission is not allowed. Accidents sometimes happen, let the user know it was a mistake.

## Reporting a Problem, Issue, or Bug
To report a problem the best way to get attention is to create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues ). You may post a follow-up question on the #general channel.
