# This is an example script that creates etcd clusters.
# Vitess requires a global cluster, as well as one for each cell.
#
# For automatic discovery, an etcd cluster can be bootstrapped from an
# existing cluster. In this example, we use an externally-run discovery
# service, but you can use your own. See the etcd docs for more:
# https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/v0.4.6/Documentation/cluster-discovery.md
