                      up into shards by defining the range of keyspace IDs that each
                      shard contains. For example, you might divide the keyspace into
                      N equal-sized key ranges.  Note that this is distinct from defining
                      how each row maps to a keyspace ID, which is done in the VSchema.
                      Partitioning is purely an operational concern (scaling the infrastructure),
                      while VSchema is an application-level concern (modeling relationships
                      between data). This separation of concerns allows resharding
                      to occur generically at the infrastructure level without any
                      knowledge of the data model.  Each partitioning must define
                      a set of shards that fully covers the space of all possible
                      keyspace IDs; there can be no gaps between ranges. There's usually
                      only one partitioning present at a time, but during resharding,
                      it's necessary to launch the destination shards alongside the
                      source shards. When the resharding is complete, the old partitioning
                      can be removed, which will turn down (undeploy) any unneeded
                      shards.  If only some shards are being split or joined during
                      resharding, the shards that aren't changing must be specified
                      in both partitionings, although the common shards will be shared
                      (only deployed once). If the per-shard configuration differs,
                      the configuration in the latter partitioning (in the order listed
                      in this field) will be used. For this reason, it's recommended
                      to add new partitionings at the end, and only remove partitionings
                      from the beginning.  This field is required. An unsharded keyspace

            partitionings:
              description: Partitionings specify how to divide the keyspace up into
                shards by defining the range of keyspace IDs that each shard contains.
                For example, you might divide the keyspace into N equal-sized key
                ranges.  Note that this is distinct from defining how each row maps
                to a keyspace ID, which is done in the VSchema. Partitioning is purely
                an operational concern (scaling the infrastructure), while VSchema
                is an application-level concern (modeling relationships between data).
                This separation of concerns allows resharding to occur generically
                at the infrastructure level without any knowledge of the data model.  Each
                partitioning must define a set of shards that fully covers the space
                of all possible keyspace IDs; there can be no gaps between ranges.
                There's usually only one partitioning present at a time, but during
                resharding, it's necessary to launch the destination shards alongside
                the source shards. When the resharding is complete, the old partitioning
                can be removed, which will turn down (undeploy) any unneeded shards.  If
                only some shards are being split or joined during resharding, the
                shards that aren't changing must be specified in both partitionings,
                although the common shards will be shared (only deployed once). If
                the per-shard configuration differs, the configuration in the latter
                partitioning (in the order listed in this field) will be used. For
                this reason, it's recommended to add new partitionings at the end,
                and only remove partitionings from the beginning.  This field is required.
                An unsharded keyspace may be specified as a partitioning into 1 part.
