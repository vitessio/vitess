# Helm Charts

This directory contains [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)
charts for running [Vitess](http://vitess.io) on
[Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io).

Note that this is not in the `examples` directory because these are the
sources for canonical packages that we plan to publish to the official
[Kubernetes Charts Repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts).
However, you may also find them useful as a starting point for creating
customized charts for your site, or other general-purpose charts for
common cluster variations.
