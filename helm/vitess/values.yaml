# This file contains default values for vitess.
#
# You can override these defaults when installing:
#   helm install -f site-values.yaml .
#
# The contents of site-values.yaml will be merged into this default config.
# It's not necessary to copy the defaults into site-values.yaml.
#
# For command-line flag maps like backupFlags or extraFlags,
# use 'flag_name: true|false' to enable or disable a boolean flag.

# The main topology map declares what resources should be created.
# Values for each component (etcd, vtctld, ...) that are not specified here
# will be taken from defaults defined below.
